  - title: "Consulting"
    description: "Perhaps you already have a website but are finding it difficult to maintain and scale. I specialize in building maintainable front-end architectures; breaking code into maintainable pieces so that it is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. I am available for code reviews, and style guide development to help you and your team focus on the work that matters."
  - title: "concise.css"
    description: "concise.css is a front-end framework that I started building in 2012 to help provide myself with baseline functionality for the various client websites that I was working on at the time. It has since become a wonderful open source project helping developers focus on building beautiful interfaces and not what grid system to use or how to handle color palettes and responsiveness."
