    headline: 'Product Tour'
    description: |
      I built a "Product Tour" interactive component to aid our marketing efforts for specific product use cases.

      We relied heavily on imagery and animations throughout the component, causing me to consider how to mitigate performance implications carefully.

      I implemented deep linking for each page in this component, which allowed our marketing team to track and reference specific pieces of content.

<!-- Highlight Webby awards and nominations -->

I'm quite proud of how many things I built so long ago are still in use today. Hell, even the Asana blog is standing strong atop my 2014 code!

## Behind the scenes

### Internal style guide and pattern library
I honed my skills in frontend architecture as I helped design and develop the first attempts at a pattern library and web style guide. As a rapidly-growing company, I anticipated the need for greater consistency across our codebase and brand identity as our marketing and sales became more aggressive. 

I led the charge on building a "componentized" frontend, helped establish coding standards, and reduced the amount of code written to solve common problems.

### Hiring
Asana grew from 70 to 700 employees in my five years there, with the web development team alone increasing from 2 to 10. 

I helped our hiring initiatives by interviewing candidates, crafting interview questions, and making key hiring decisions.

### Developer experience
I helped incorporate robust build processes for managing assets in our codebase for an improved developer experience.
