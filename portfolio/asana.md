    headline: 'Asana Blog'
    description: |
      My first project after joining Asana involved consolidating multiple WordPress blogs into a single blog. In doing so, I took ownership over the blogs and built a custom theme and plugins to aid content marketing efforts.
      
      I led onboarding sessions for new hires who would be working on the Asana blog. I also wrote extensive documentation for the platform for content editors and developers.

    headline: 'Wavelength'
    description: |
      Wavelength was part of a content marketing strategy geared toward positioning Asana as a thought leader in work management and company culture. 

      To aid in this effort, I built a custom WordPress theme with custom taxonomies to provide our marketing team with a digital "magazine" of sorts.

## Behind the scenes

<!-- https://fontawesome.com/icons/solar-system?s=light&f=classic -->
### Internal style guide and pattern library
I honed my skills in frontend architecture as I helped design and develop the first attempts at a pattern library and web style guide. As a rapidly-growing company, I anticipated the need for greater consistency across our codebase and brand identity as our marketing and sales became more aggressive. 

I led the charge on building a "componentized" frontend, helped establish coding standards, and reduced the amount of code written to solve common problems.

### Hiring
Asana grew from 70 to 700 employees in my five years there, with the web development team alone increasing from 2 to 10. 

I helped our hiring initiatives by interviewing candidates, crafting interview questions, and making key hiring decisions.

### Developer experience
I helped incorporate robust build processes for managing assets in our codebase for an improved developer experience.
