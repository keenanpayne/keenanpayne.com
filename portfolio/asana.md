    description: |
      I collaborated with marketers to build countless landing pages announcing new product features and corning the work management market.

      It was not uncommon for me to turn around complex landing pages in two weeks at Asana. I worked on <em>many</em> tight deadlines and consistently produced high-quality work.

    headline: 'Asana Blog'
    description: |
      I helped consolidate multiple WordPress blogs that served different purposes. Furthermore, I took ownership over WordPress, building a custom theme for the blog and custom plugins for various functionality. 
      
      As such, I was responsible for onboarding folks at Asana to WordPress by helping manage accounts, writing documentation on the platform and our systems, and troubleshooting issues from stakeholders.

## During my time at Asana...

I honed my skills in frontend architecture as I helped design and develop the first attempts at a pattern library and web style guide. As a rapidly-growing company, I anticipated the need for greater consistency across our codebase and brand identity as our marketing and sales became more aggressive. 
- I led the charge on building a "componentized" frontend, helped establish coding standards, and reduced the amount of code written to solve common problems.

Asana grew from 70 to 700 employees in my five years there, with the web development team alone increasing from 2 to 10. 
- I helped our hiring initiatives by interviewing candidates, crafting interview questions, and making key hiring decisions.

I helped incorporate robust build processes for managing assets in our codebase for an improved developer experience.
