# ### Internal style guide and pattern library
# I honed my skills in frontend architecture as I helped design and develop the first attempts at a pattern library and web style guide. As a rapidly-growing company, I anticipated the need for greater consistency across our codebase and brand identity as our marketing and sales became more aggressive. 

# I led the charge on building a "componentized" frontend, helped establish coding standards, and reduced the amount of code written to solve common problems.

# ### Hiring
# Asana grew from 70 to 700 employees in my five years there, with the web development team alone increasing from 2 to 10. 

# I helped our hiring initiatives by interviewing candidates, crafting interview questions, and making key hiring decisions.

# ### Developer experience
# I helped incorporate robust build processes for managing assets in our codebase for an improved developer experience.
