From Kelsea:

**What was the problem you had before you hired me?**

We had a new editorial hub on our website that needed to be built out, and we wanted it to live on Wordpress.

**What made my services stand out from other options?**

Keenan came well recommended, and after speaking with him I was impressed by his positive attitude and willingness to work into our team workflow.

**What have you been able to achieve as a result of working with me?**

We were able to launch the GoFundMe Heroes Hub, a beautiful new home for all of our editorial brand content. It has been very well received and our team loves using it to post new content.

**What specific feature did you like most about working with me?**

Keenan was amazing at communication, meeting/exceeding deadlines, and making himself available for fixes & troubleshooting in the immediate stretch after the project had launched.

**Would you recommend my services to others? If so, why?**

I would recommend Keenan very highly, he was amazing to work with and I hope to be able to work with him again in the future!

**Anything else?**

I was especially appreciative of Keenan figuring out how to incorporate our podcast channel right into our content Hub. We had no idea how and he was able to figure it out, which was a big deal for us.
