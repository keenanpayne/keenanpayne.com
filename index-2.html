  - title: "concise.css"
    description: "concise.css is a front-end framework that I started building in 2012 to help provide myself with baseline functionality for the various client websites that I was working on at the time. It has since become a wonderful open source project helping developers focus on building beautiful interfaces and not what grid system to use or how to handle color palettes and responsiveness."
