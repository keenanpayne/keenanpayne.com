  <p>What are you confused about?</p>

  <p>—George</p>
</div>

Huh, that's broad. So broad, in fact, that I procrastinated responding to the message, concerned with the avalanche of thought that might manifest once I gave it my full attention. With my period of procrastination complete, I'm ready to be buried beneath a pile of unknowing as I capture my thoughts on a question whose answers reveal more obscurity than clarity.

I will note, perhaps needlessly, that I'm not attempting to capture __everything__ that confuses me. That would be an impossible and silly endeavor. Instead, I will work my way through this question one step at a time, capturing my thoughts until I've exhausted my desire to engage with the prompt.

I suppose that the time commitment required to answer this question played a role in my procrastination, not that I fully understood the time commitment for answering it, given its broad scope. Still, I sensed that this would be a multi-hour endeavor if I gave the question my full attention.

Furthermore, I felt fearful of engaging with this question as it required me to face aspects of my being where I lack clarity. This insecurity doesn't prevent me from investigating such aspects of my being, but I feel resistance by capturing and sharing them through my writing.

I suppose this is an exercise in vulnerability through [self-reflection](/tags/self-reflection/).

My writing practice is an area where I experience confusion and resistance. While I love writing for self-reflection, learning, and sharing, I struggle with feelings of self-doubt, overthinking, and an obsession with the "perfection" of what I've written.

{% include type/question.html, content: 'Must my writing be an arduous endeavor?' %}

I mean, writing my thoughts isn't difficult. In fact, stream-of-consciousness writing is effortless without focusing on editing, self-censorship, the reader, and goals for the finished product. I'm aware of this, but I'm still practicing pushing such inclinations out of my mind while writing.

{% include type/question.html, content: 'Why not make my writing effortless?' %}

I edit while I write a lot. Every word, sentence, and turn of phrase is intended to articulate my thoughts to the best of my abilities. I wouldn't want you to think that I'm unintelligent, would I? 

{% include type/question.html, content: 'Why do I care what you think about my intelligence?<br>Even if I knew how you perceived my intelligence, would that matter?' %}

If I'm writing to an audience of people at this moment, I couldn't tell you who this audience might be, save for the few friends, family members, and acquaintances who care about me enough personally to read what I write from time to time.

I hope they don't think I'm going crazy.

{% include type/question.html, content: "But what of goals?<br>What's a life with no goals?" %}

Writing without goals, although a personal struggle of mine, is not at all unattainable. I'm getting better at it by the day. 

Other aspects of our lives, on the other hand, are __begging__ for goals.

If I want to retire by 55 with millions in the bank, I need some predictable long-term returns on my investments.

How do I make such investments? By securing a career as a sought-after web developer. By helping others meet __their__ goals, I earn income that allows me to meet mine. Quid pro quo.

{% include type/question.html, content: 'Why am I so interested in planning for retirement?' %}

I suppose retirement planning is something that's programmed into my brain, having come of age in a [late capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_capitalism) society. It's a dog-eat-dog world, so I better get to hoarding wealth for some indeterminate future.

The task of hoarding wealth comes at the cost of directing our actions to serve this goal.

{% include type/question.html, content: 'How do I determine the actions I take?' %}

Actions are an atomic unit of being. It's through action that life is made possible; it's the reason I'm writing these very words. But how do I determine what action to take? With experience predicated on answering the question of "what action to take," you would think I would be better at answering it after living twenty-eight years.

I frequently ask myself whether the actions I'm taking are an authentic representation of who I am, who I desire to become, and what I value.

{% include type/question.html, content: 'What do I value?<br>Am I living in accordance with my values?<br>Are my actions an authentic representation of who I am?<br>How frequently do my actions reflect how I would like to be perceived rather than an authentic representation of who I am?' %}

{% include type/question.html, content: 'What is meaningful to me?' %}

My relationships with people I love and care about; the wellbeing of myself and those I care about; experiencing personal growth; spending time helping and empowering others. 

Aligning my actions in service of these—which are effectively my [foundational values](https://www.theminimalists.com/v/)—makes time spent feel worthwhile.

I noticed that concerning myself with money __didn't__ make the cut for my foundational values. Yet, I still spend so much time striving to meet my financial goals through the actions I take. In striving for the "American dream," it appears that my values and actions are out of lockstep.

To what extent am I comfortable with my actions and values being out of alignment?
