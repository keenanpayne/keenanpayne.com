<p class="_text-h3">Hey there, I'm Keenan ‚úåüèª</p>

<p class="_text-h5">Thank you for visiting my website! <br class="_hidden-720">Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>

By trade, I'm a web developer [^1]. I spend my "working" time building websites and web applications. Like the website you're on right now‚ÄîI built this! ‚ú®

I've also built websites for cool companies like <a href="https://asana.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asana</a>, <a href="https://trysparrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparrow</a>, <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/c/heroes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoFundMe</a>, <a href="https://collectivei.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collective[i], <a href="https://transform.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transform</a>, and <a href="https://neuralink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neuralink</a>,  to name _a few_. I've been doing this for 13 years professionally, so I've lent a hand working on _countless_ of projects. [^2]

[^1]: My trade struggles naming job positions and titles. I'm also referred to as a frontend developer/engineer, software developer/engineer, or <strong>webmaster</strong>. 

[^2]: These are all websites that I have built myself, with collaborators, or as an individual contributor. More details to come once I launch my portfolio!

I specialize in [frontend architecture](/services/frontend-architecture), which is a term I use to encapsulate the spectrum of roles I employ as a web developer. I build beautiful web pages, architect codebases from scratch, embark on large-scale refactoring efforts, hire teams of web developers, mentor others on their development journies&hellip; you get the point. I do a lot.

<a href="https://concisecss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concise CSS</a> is a personal achievement on my journey towards web development mastery. The project was conceived from my annoyance tediously writing duplicate code across different client projects. [^3] Through this project, I met my friend and ongoing professional collaborator, <a href="https://jaime.one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaime Hern√°ndez</a>. [^4]

[^3]: The web development landscape was _much_ different in 2014. Component-based methodologies, paradigms, and frameworks were slowly arising from similar pain points across the industry. Frameworks like Bootstrap and Concise were designed to address such issues as thoughtfully as possible. We've learned a lot since then.

[^4]: Remember those sites I mentioned above? Jaime had a hand in helping build _many_ of them. 

Long story short, I build beautiful, scalable web experiences that everyone will love. I'll help you meet your goals and do so by crafting the highest-quality product I can, given the circumstances.
