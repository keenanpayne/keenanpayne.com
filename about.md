    body: '
    <p>By trade, I am a web developer and web designer. In fact, I built this website you are on right now! ‚ú®</p>
    
    <p>So far, I have spent my career building beautiful things on the internet for myself and others. I create beautiful web pages, design pretty user interfaces, help companies achieve their goals, and <a href="/services" title="View services">so much more</a>.</p>
    
    <p>I have been lucky enough to use these skills to help cool companies like <a href="/portfolio/asana" title="View Asana case study">Asana</a>, <a href="/portfolio/rippling" title="View Rippling case study">Rippling</a>, <a href="/portfolio/gofundme" title="View GoFundMe case study">GoFundMe</a>, and <a href="/portfolio/" title="View portfolio">many others</a>. I have been doing this for 15 years professionally, so I have lent a hand working on <em>countless</em> projects.</p>
    
    <p>In my free time, I love spending time with my partner, family, and friends. I travel all over the place, usually to see those I love. You may also see me at a concert ‚Äî I go to about 30 shows a year. Or, you may find me at your local game store playing some Magic: The Gathering</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to connect digitally. If you want to get in touch, feel free to <a href="/contact" title="Contact me">reach out</a>.</p>'
