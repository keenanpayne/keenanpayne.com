This is the repository for my personal website. I used my own front-end CSS framework Concise (https://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css) for the design as well as some custom styles, and wrote a couple of simple NPM build scripts to compile everything. 

Feel free to fork this and use my code and designs for whatever you'd like. You can add credit to myself if you please, but it's not necessary.
