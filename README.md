This is the repository for my personal website. I used my own front-end CSS framework Concise (https://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css) for the design as well as some custom styles, and wrote a couple of simple NPM build scripts to compile everything. 

Feel free to fork this and use my code and designs for whatever you'd like. You can add credit to myself if you please, but it's not necessary. 

### Compilation

1. Fork the repo
2. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. CD into the folder: `cd ../path/to/directory`
4. Install NPM dependencies: `npm install`
5. Run NPM build script: `npm run build` or `npm run build:watch`

### To Do

- [ ] Use a static site generator to reduce duplicate code (Harp.js, Jekyll, etc)
- [ ] Add a "Labs" section that contains more isolated code snippets and examples
- [ ] Add more items to my portfolio from past projects
- [ ] Add "Case Studies" to my portfolio that delves deeper into select projects
- [ ] Clean up responsiveness between portfolio sections on devices (sometimes portfolio images shrink and it creates a lot of space between the images and the "Open Source" section)
