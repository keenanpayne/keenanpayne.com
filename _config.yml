## Welcome to Jekyll!
## ------------------
## This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
## which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
## yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
## feature for the data you need to update frequently.
##
## For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
## 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.


##
## Site Settings
## -------------
## These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
## you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
## You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
## in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
