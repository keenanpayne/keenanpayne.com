lede: Thoughtfully making foundational decisions on how to construct complex user interfaces.

<p class="services-callout">Scaling codebases is difficult. When needs outpace available resources, technical debt accrues more quickly and becomes difficult to mitigate.</p>

<p class="services-callout">Everyone and everything suffers as technical debt piles up. Developers can end up working a sub-par codebase that impedes the ability to produce high-quality work efficiently; stakeholders cannot meet the needs of a growing company; your company is limited in its ability to grow and make an impact.</p>

## What I offer

Frontend architecture is a subset of my frontend development specialization. The emphasis on __architecture__ intends to illuminate the __concerted__—not __inherent__—effort required to craft resilient and scalable user interfaces.

I offer my specialization in frontend architecture to organizations intent on designing and developing long-term solutions for complex user interfaces. 

After working together, you will receive a bespoke frontend architecture designed to your specific needs! If we've done our job correctly, we will have addressed any core concerns that you and others have been encountering with your codebase/existing frontend architecture while keeping an eye on how your company may grow in the future. 

## My process
### Requirements gathering

I work rigorously to [gather requirements](#faq-requirements) for your project so that smart architectural choices can be made that solve your short-term goals while keeping an eye towards the future. 

### Tooling

I will happily integrate with your preferred tooling/frameworks if you have already made core architectural decisions. For areas with greater ambiguity, I can guide the decision-making process governing essential decisions that can provide confidence in choosing the right tool that solves your needs.

Learn how I incorporate build tooling [here](#faq-tooling).
### Documentation

Context provides developers with a helpful mental model for reasoning about a codebase. Context also helps stakeholders understand the process taken to accomplish their goals. Lacking context, developers get lost in a sea of ambiguity, and as a result, poor decisions get made with good intent, and work happens inefficiently and inconsistently. I seek to avoid this confusion by generating documentation for codebases as I architect them. This up-front investment paves the way for long-term clarity for developers and stakeholders alike.

What gets written gets understood.

### Time

The quality of what I produce is time- and scope-dependent. I can craft a resilient and composable codebase with a flexible time horizon and a clear goal. Crafting complex frontend architectures typically requires __significant__ time investment, but I firmly believe that it is worth the effort for any long-term software development endeavor.

## FAQ

### What is my requirements gathering process?
  - Interview team members to become educated on the company and problem domain. Some sample questions include
    - What is your current tech stack?
    - What is your "ideal" tech stack?
    - What past architectural decisions have you made?
        - What has gone well?
        - What has gone wrong?
    - What shortcomings you definitely want to avoid having learning from the past?
    - If one thing could be an "out-of-the-park" success for you and your team, what would that be?

### How do I implement build tooling into my frontend architectures?
- I implement robust build processes using Node.js and NPM to provide a modern and intuitive developer experience. Don't expect a big Webpack mess with my projects—I focus on providing only the simplest solutions to problems before finding advanced solutions (i.e., starting with `npm scripts`).
    - Webpack is fine, of course, but it's often used as a __starting point__ when it should be viewed as a __potential future outcome__ following smaller-scale build process implementations. 
        - Mindfulness matters when it comes to making decisions that are so frequently addressed as "one size fits all."
