Few things have surprised me while [switching from Android to iPhone](/switch-from-android-to-iphone/) more than how terrible the iOS calculator is. I certainly didn't anticipate that something as _seemingly_ trivial as a calculator app would be what irks me to my core following my change in devices. Well, here we are.

When I purchase a new smartphone, I have baseline expectations for how the phone operates and what features it provides. Following my recent purchase of the iPhone 13 Pro from Apple at a whopping $1,300—sans Apple Care+ and an overpriced but still beautiful leather case—I don't think expectations are unreasonable. I don't expect the world from our monopolistic tech overlords; I expect a decent user experience. Fair enough, right?

While I've found myself primarily delighted by the iOS user experience and core functionality, the iOS calculator is something I continue to fall back on as an example of how unintuitive, lazy, and embarrassing Apple can be. Within my first few uses of the app, I found myself scouring the App Store, searching for a replacement.

Let's get into what makes the iOS calculator so terrible and why Apple should be embarrassed by it.

## Form over function

Let's not pretend that Apple isn't _frequently_ guilty of prioritizing form over function. In fact, Apple so often indulges this trade-off for their devices and software that the recent launch of the 2021 MacBook Pro heralded praise from tech critics and users alike, as the company ditched their all-in approach towards USB-C in favor of a diverse set of ports across their professional-grade laptops. Yes, let's all praise Apple for offering more than single port type on laptops that charge $2000+.

Thankfully, the default iOS calculator, while suffering from the same over-focus on form over function, is less detrimental to the core experience of using an iPhone than other Apple gaffes. Unless you frequently use the calculator.

### Calculation alongside answer  

Let's start with the most glaring omission in the iOS calculator functionality, the inability to see calculations alongside answers. What do I mean? On an iPhone, type 1+2, then press equals (=). You see 3, right? Same. But why don't I see what calculation led to the answer?

With 6.1 inches of **Super Retina XDR ProMotion display**, I expect affordance given to information that is not only contextually relevant, but contextually _imperative_. How one gets from point A to point B when using a calculator isn't a "nice to have"; it's core functionality that should be included in any modern calculator software.

I mean, what is all of this screen space for if it isn't used for something important? Sure, the **massive** calculator buttons are nice for fat-fingered users like me, but how much affordance do these buttons deserve compared to other helpful information or features?

### Instant calculation results  

For years, the default calculator app on Android has offered instant calculations without explicitly finishing a calculation. For example, say I type in 1+2 but don't finish the calculation by pressing equals (=)—the final calculation still appears on the screen. This allows me to effortlessly see how the output of different equations changes.

Instant calculation results aren't core functionality—it's a "nice to have." Still, similar to Apple's poor use of screen real estate for displaying calculations alongside answers, such functionality seems like an obvious addition given how much space is available in the default iOS calculator app.

### Unintuitive backspace  

As Apple is wont to do with their devices—specifically the iPhone and iPad—functionality is hidden beneath a layer of unclear and sometimes unintuitive gesture controls.

Such is the case for the backspace functionality on the iOS calculator, which features no visible backspace button, only a button that clears the entire calculation. Such an omission stymied me until I found [this tweet by Yashar Ali](https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1264558095318913024), who points out that you _can_ delete individual characters from a calculation by swiping right on the calculation (but only the calculation, not swiping right against the other calculator keys).

Is this gesture's existence made clear to iOS users? No. Instead of clarifying what gestures are available for the application or even mentioning it upon opening the calculator for the first time, Apple expects you to stumble across a random tweet. How intuitive.

### No calculation history  

Say you're daring enough to want to use your calculator for more than a single calculation. Perhaps you might even want to perform multiple contextually relevant calculations, such that it's helpful to reference earlier calculations after making later calculations.

In this instance, it would be essential to have a "calculation history" that helps users easily reference past calculations. Is this possible on the iOS calculator? Not at all.

Swipe as you might, but no gestures will display your previous calculations. This functionality has been baked into Android for years, so lacking it on iOS is disappointing.

### Apple should be embarrassed

I can only assume the vision by Apple designers and engineers is to provide a "simple" user experience with the iOS calculator. However, such simplicity has become counter-productive, leaving the iPhone with a sub-par piece of software that should be _table stakes_ for any major operating system manufacturer charging exorbitant prices for their devices.

Is the sole purpose of owning an iPhone to use the calculator? Obviously not. But I contend that having a functional, well-designed calculator is a common enough use-case for having a portable computer in your pocket that it should be done well. 

Whether I want to calculate a tip or calculate the ratio for my pour-over coffee, I *expect* to do so with ease. Why shouldn't I? Apple, an almost **$3 trillion** company at the time of writing, has more than enough resources to build a decent calculator to accompany their $1300 phone.

I suppose it's the relative simplicity of building a half-decent calculator, along with the outsized resources Apple has at its disposal for such a feat, that make this sub-par experience so annoying. You can have the most beautiful landing page for your product and showcase all of the tech specs you want, but neither cover up shoddy prioritization, design, and engineering for the simplest smartphone use-cases.

Ultimately, Apple is a company run by individuals who feel like they can usher in a sea change with how people interact with their devices. In large part, they can, as the craze for owning an Apple device is sky-high (particularly among [Gen Z](https://piper2.bluematrix.com/docs/pdf/3bad99c6-e44a-4424-8fb1-0e3adfcbd1d4.pdf)).

## An alternative calculator for iPhone

Of course, I wouldn't end this article complaining about the built-in iOS calculator without providing a decent alternative.

Based on my personal needs and a bit of research online, I've found [PCalc](https://pcalc.com/) to be the best free and paid calculator alternative for _all_ Apple devices, including the iPhone.  

The [PCalc iPhone app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-the-best-calculator/id284666222?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4D6) is a full-featured calculator app worthy of praise that addresses all of my complaints _and then some_. I started by trying the [PCalc Lite](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite/id300311831) app for free but quickly decided to support the developer for the premium version.

I suppose if there's something positive to be taken away from Apple's inability to build a functional calculator app, it's that independent app developers such as [James](https://twitter.com/jamesthomson) have the opportunity to create excellent alternatives, giving us the chance to support them.

Now, if only Apple weren't taking 30% of all App Store sales and subscriptions.
