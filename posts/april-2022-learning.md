## Book: [Creative Visualization](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781608684649)

Creative Visualization has been popping up a lot recently. I first introduced to it through Eckhart Tolle's _The Power of Now_, which I discussed [last month](/march-2022-learning/). It was recommended again in James Clear's _Atomic Habits_, which finally spurred me to read it.

This book is an easy to read, providing succinct and insightful meditations on living a meaningful and purposeful life by harnessing our creative potential using visualization techniques.

The way it actually works is the reverse. You must first be who you really are, then do what you need to do, in order to have what you want.", author: "Shakti Gawain" %}

## Book: [Atomic Habits](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735211292)

One of my foundational values is to _always be learning and growing_. As a result, I’ve long been interested in understanding and implementing techniques for changing my own behavior (e.g., habits, routines).

In striving to be the best version of myself, I've read countless books on behavior change and habits. Atomic Habits initially caught my eye due to its massive popularity in the personal development field. Since I'm going through a period of intense personal and professional growth, I wanted to see what all of the fuss is about.

I’m so happy I finally decided to give Atomic Habits a read and listen. James Clear concisely articulates his understanding of the subject in a way that informs and inspires. Despite having a relatively strong understanding of this field, I was able to take away some applicable knowledge.

{% include "type/note.html" content: "When attempting to instill any behavior change, break down your desired change into the smallest possible steps that can be taken. Then, focus only on the first step. Commit to taking this first step repeatedly. Focus on consistency and building momentum without losing focus on the big-picture goal you have." %}

## Article: [Mental Health Tips feat. Anxiety Wolf](https://ncase.me/mental-health/)

I've struggled with a fair bit of anxiety over the past couple of years, so this article resonated.

I greatly appreciate Nicky's vulnerability and honesty as she shares her experiences with anxiety and the approaches she's used for framing and managing her anxiety. It's an impactful read.

{% include "type/blockquote.html", content: "All signals can have false alarms. Thus, negative feelings aren't always valid, but they aren't always irrational either. They're clues – not to be taken as 100% literal truth, but not to be thrown out entirely either.", author: "Nicky Case" %}

{% include "type/note.html" content: "Collaborate with the feelings we experience. Listen to them, don't fight against them. Understand what our feelings are telling us and be grateful that our mind (however imperfect it might be) cares enough to want to protect us." %}

## Book: [The Icarus Deception](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781591846079)

I'm a big fan of Seth Godin. I regularly enjoy [his blog](https://seths.blog/), where he publishes wonderfully concise thoughts and reflections daily. I've also enjoyed countless books that he's written. [^1]

[^1]: Big thanks to my BFF [Jon Horiel](https://jonathanhoriel.com) for introducing me to Seth Godin and countless other authors and books over the years.

In his book, The Icarus Deception, Seth expounds on the purpose and utility of art in the modern world. He challenges the reader to view whatever work we do as art and why such a framing is essential for succeeding in the modern creative economy.

Seth's writing is approachable, inspiring, and practical. I reach for it whenever I want to feel inspired and reaffirm the value and utility of the art I'm creating.

{% include "type/blockquote.html", content: "Art is personal and is built on attitude and vision and commitment.", author: "Seth Godin" %}

{% include "type/note.html" content: "Don't wait for others to open the door for you to create and make an impact. Open the door yourself and demand the attention of others through your efforts." %}

## Podcast: [Make Art Not Content: The Struggle](https://podcastaddict.com/episode/https%3A%2F%2Fchrt.fm%2Ftrack%2FFAB4C8%2Fdts.podtrac.com%2Fredirect.mp3%2Fmedia.transistor.fm%2F29b8c9a3%2F5dad47a3.mp3&podcastId=2953181)

Making art is difficult, but what happens when we get so caught up in what we _envision_ creating that we prevent our art from speaking for itself?

I highly recommend checking out the [Make Art Not Content](https://makeartnotcontent.com/) podcast for any creative people. Each episode is a 5–10 minute meditation on creativity, addressing the common hurdles creative people regularly encounter.
