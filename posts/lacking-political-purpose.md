I was struck by a quote on the importance of political purpose while reading George Orwell's [Why I Write](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780143036357):

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "Looking back through my work, I see that it is invariably where I lacked a political purpose that I wrote lifeless books and was betrayed into purple passages, sentences without meaning, decorative adjectives, and humbug generally." author: "George Orwell" %}

Orwell's comment spurred me to reflect on how a political purpose might give my actions more significant meaning.

I generally consider myself politically aware and engaged. I keep up on current events; I put substantial time into educating myself before voting; I strive to maintain an open mind when confronting new ideas; I eagerly and tactfully debate folks with different beliefs in the pursuit of fostering open dialogue; I've canvassed for political candidates, etc. 

These traits are well and good, though I’m confronting an increased feeling of emptiness as I reflect on the impact of my efforts given our current political, social, and economic landscape. 

{% include type/p_large.html, content: "I feel like I'm not doing enough to advocate for the change I want to see in the world." %}

During these moments of internal strife, I effortlessly belittle myself and my life situation. 

Of course I'm not doing enough to help push for a better world. I spend my time writing code, so companies can generate obscene amounts of wealth that invariably gets funneled into the hands of the _few_ rather than the _many_. What do I get in return? A chunk of the wealth, putting me in company with the _few_. 

Tearing myself down does no good, especially while reflecting on how I can put myself in service of advocating for a better world.

I'm using the skills I've gained during the past 15 years to secure a financial future for myself and my family. But with that financial security comes the ability to use my time and resources to help others.

## Finding political purpose

What inspired George Orwell to make the change in his life and writing, away from "sentences without meaning," toward his political purpose?

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "The Spanish war and other events in 1936–7 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against Totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism, as I understand it." author: "George Orwell" %}

I feel the urge to make a similar change in my life. I want to put my skills, passion, and effort toward advancing a social, political, and economic agenda that will help make the world a better place for everyone.

{% include type/p_large.html, content: "I want to align my actions more closely with my values." %}

I'm not entirely sure how this will manifest. Without a plan of attack for making such a change, I run the risk of maintaining the status quo and keeping to business as usual.

By sharing these thoughts publically, I hope I can create some accountability with myself and maintain momentum toward making a change.

### Brainstorming opportunities to engage with my political purpose

Here are a few ideas I've been considering that involve using my skills as a web developer in ways that align with my political beliefs:

- Improve the online presence of political candidates with a similar political ideology/agenda.
- Collaborate with leftist publishers like [Jacobin](https://jacobin.com) to introduce more folks to Social Democratic, Socialist, and Marxist ideologies through compelling and thoughtful journalism.
- Go rogue and create some platform/community/software for advancing my political purpose.

Stepping outside of my vocation as a web developer, I've considered:

- Running for some civic/legislative/governmental position in my community.
- Helping advance political campaigns through volunteer efforts. 
- Finding more ways to foster engagement between people with seemingly disparate beliefs. 

Who knows? There are countless ways I can more closely align my actions with my values and put myself in service of a political purpose. 

Making this change isn't something I want to rush, but it is something I want to continue thinking about and act on sooner rather than later.
