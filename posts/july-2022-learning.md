Things have been busy in my world. Summer traveling and client work have been my primary focus for the past few weeks, hence this belatedly-published learning notes. Better late than never!  

## Magazine: [Anxy: The Workaholism Issue]()

I've never described myself as a workaholic. Instead, I've attributed my _inclination_ to work as being a function of my grit, determination, and industriousness. All positive things, I've believed.

This belief was deftly challenged while reading the workaholism issue of Anxy. The thoughtful and personal essays have provided a nuanced understanding explanation of workaholism—it's causes, the impact it can have, and who is typically affected by it.

This new perspective has pushed me to consider whether my "inclination" to work is more of a "compulsion".

Maybe incessantly contemplating the various goals, projects, and tasks I'm working on (or want to work on) at any given time isn't simply the sign of a good work ethic, as I've thought. Perhaps this behavior is what's caused so much anxiety and stress that have led me to burnout multiple times in my career.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "People who have high work engagement—a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind are probably not workaholics. Engaged workers are driven to work because they find it intrinsically pleasurable. They truly enjoy it—while workaholics are driven to work because they feel an inner compulsion." %}

## Article: [Burnout](https://alistapart.com/article/burnout/) 

I appreciate and admire the vulnerability of folks who have shared their experiences with burnout. Articles like this have been useful as I continue reflecting on my own struggles with burnout over the past few years.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "Stress may come from too many meetings, projects, responsibilities, unrealistic deadlines, improperly set expectations, distractions, or any number of other things prevalent in our hyper-connected world." %}

## Book: [Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life]()

Few books inspire me so much that I complete them the same month that I start them. Hence why regular readers of this column see me repeatedly reference books that end up taking me months, if not years, to complete (let's ignore the books I never finish, which are *most* books I start).

The same can't be said for Bird by Bird, a wonderfully inspiring book by Anne Lamot. Anne shares anecdotes from her life as a writer to impart practical advice for aspiring writers.

## Article: [On Learning](https://www.compendiousthunks.com/musings/on-learning/)

The author of this post emphasizes the importance of learning in public by writing and sharing what he's learned by Blogging. Whenever he is learning something new, he writes about it on his blog for others.

This is something I aspire to do on my blog, and through this column. I haven't nailed the commitment to publishing that **<author's name>** has, though it's something I aspire to.

## Book: [Several Short Sentences About Writing](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780307279415)

I've been working my way through this book since [March](/march-2022-learning/), and I'm continuing to find inspiration for my writing practice.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "Being a writer is an act of perpetual self-authorization.", author: "" %}

{% include type/tip.html, content: "Practice noticing things around you. Don't concern yourself with writing everything all the time. Because the source of great writing comes from great attention." %}

## Book: Anything You Want

I'm continuing to work through Derek Sivers's books, which I purchased **<insert month back link learning notes here>**. So many great nuggets of wisdom and food for thought.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "Don't be on your deathbed someday, having squandered your one chance at life, full of regret because you pursued little distractions instead of big dreams.", author: "Derek Sivers" %}
