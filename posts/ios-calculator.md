Few things have surprised me [switching from Android to iPhone](/switch-from-android-to-iphone/) more than how terrible the iOS calculator is. I certainly didn't anticipate that following my change in devices, something as _seemingly_ trivial as a calculator app would be what irks me to my core. Well, here we are.  

Nowadays, when I purchase a new smartphone, I have baseline expectations for how the phone operates along with what features it provides. Following my recent purchase of the iPhone 13 Pro from Apple at a whopping $1,300 USD—sans Apple Care+ and an overpriced, but still beautiful leather case—I don't think setting expectations is unreasonable. I don't expect the world from our monopolistic tech overlords, but I expect a decent user experience and functionality that is on par with the competition. Fair enough, right?  

One might imagine that at a cost of $1300, Apple could offer the users of its devices a suite of pre-installed applications that handle   

While I've found myself largely delighted by the iOS user experience and core functionality, the iOS calculator is something I continue to fall back on as an example of how unintuitive, lazy, and embarrassing Apple can be. Within the first few uses I found myself scouring through the App Store searching for a replacement.

Let's get into what makes the iOS calculator so terrible, and why Apple should be absolutely embarrassed by it.  

## Form over function

Let's not pretend that Apple isn't _frequently_ guilty of prioritizing form over function. In fact, Apple so frequently indulges this trade-off for their devices and software that the recent launch of the 2021 MacBook Pro heralded praise from tech critics and users alike, as the company ditched their all-in approach towards towards USB-C in favor of a diverse set of ports across their professional-grade laptops. Yes, now let's all praise Apple for offering more than single port type on laptops that charge $2000+.

Thankfully, the default iOS calculator, while suffering from the same over-focus on form over function, is less detrimental to the core experience of using an iPhone than other Apple gaffes. That is, unless you frequently use the calculator, which I do.  

### Calculation alongside answer  

Let's start with the most glaring omission in the iOS calculator functionality, the inability to see calculation alongside answers. What do I mean? On an iPhone, type 1+2 then press equals (=). You see 3, right? Same. But why don't I see what calculation led to the answer?   

With 6.1 inches of **Super Retina XDR ProMotion display**, I expect affordance given to information that is not only contextually relevant, but contextually _imperative_. How one gets from point A to point B when using a calculator isn't a "nice to have", it's core functionality that should obviously be included in any modern calculator software.  

I mean really, what is all of this screen space for if it isn't being used for something important? Sure, the **massive** calculator buttons are nice for fat-fingered users such as myself, but how much affordance do such buttons deserve when compared to other useful information or features?  

### Instant calculation results  

For years, the default calculator app on Android has offered instant results to calculations without explicitly finishing a calculation. For example, say I type in 1+2 but don't finish the calculation by pressing equals (=)—the final calculation still appears on the screen. This allows me to effortlessly see how the output of different equations changes.

This isn't core functionality—it's a "nice to have". Still, similar to Apple's poor use of screen real estate for displaying calculations alongside answers, such functionality seems like an obvious addition given how much space is available in the default iOS calculator app.

### Unintuitive backspace  

As Apple is wont to do with their devices—specifically the iPhone and iPad—functionality is hidden beneath a layer of unclear and sometimes unintuitive gesture controls.

Such is the case for the backspace functionality on the iOS calculator, which features no visible backspace button, only a button that clears the entire calculation. I was stymied by such an omission until I found [this tweet by Yashar Ali](https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1264558095318913024) who points out that you _can_ delete individual characters from a calculation by swiping right on the calculation (but only the calculation, not swiping right against the other calculator keys).

Is this gesture's existence made clear to iOS users? No. Instead of making it clear what gestures are available for the application, or even mentioning it upon opening the calculator for the first time, Apple apparently expects you to stumble across a random tweet. How intuitive.  

### No calculation history  

Say you're daring enough to want to use your calculator for more than a single calculation. Perhaps you might even want to perform multiple calculations that are contextually relevant, such that it's useful to reference earlier calculations after making later calculations.

In this instance, it would be essential to have a "calculation history" that helps users easily reference past calculations. Is this possible on the iOS calculator? Not at all.

Swipe as you might, no gestures will display your previous calculations. This functionality has been baked into Android for years, so lacking it on iOS is disappointing.

### Apple should be embarrassed

In what I can only assume is a desire towards providing a "simple" user experience with the iOS calculator, Apple finds themselves providing an unintuitive approach towards designing a piece of software that should be _table stakes_ for any major operating system manufacturer.

Is the sole purpose of owning an iPhone to use the calculator? Obviously not. But I contend that having a functional, well-designed calculator is a common enough use-case for having a portable computer in your pocket that it should be done well. Whether I want to calculate a tip, [something else], or [something else], I _expect_ to be able to do so with ease. Why shouldn't I? Apple, an almost **$3 trillion** dollar company at the time of writing, has more than enough resources to build a decent calculator.

It's the relative simplicity of building a half-decent calculator, along with the outsized resources Apple has at its disposal that make this sub-par experience so embarrassing. For such an oft-lauded device, if not by Apple fanboys, then by Apple themselves, I expect a high-quality experience all around. You can have the most beautiful landing page for your product and showcase all of the tech specs that you want, but neither cover-up shoddy prioritization and engineering for the simplest of smartphone use-cases.  

Ultimately, Apple is a company run by individuals who feel like they can usher in a sea change with how people interact with their devices. In large part, they're able to do this, as the craze for owning an Apple device is sky-high. Apple is not penalized by its users for their shitty calculator, because if you want all of the benefits that come along with owning an iPhone, there's nowhere else you can look.

## An alternative calculator for iPhone

Of course, I wouldn't end this article complaining about the built-in iOS calculator without providing a decent alternative.

Based on my personal needs and a bit of research online, I've found [PCalc](https://pcalc.com/) to be the best free and paid calculator alternative for _all_ Apple devices, including the iPhone.  

The [PCalc iPhone app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-the-best-calculator/id284666222?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4D6) is full-featured calculator app worthy of praise that addresses all of my complaints _and then some_. I started by trying the [PCalc Lite](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite/id300311831) app for free but quickly decided to support the developer for the premium version.

I suppose if there's something positive to be taken away from Apple's inability to build a functional calculator app, it's that independent app developers such as [James](https://twitter.com/jamesthomson) have the opportunity to build really amazing alternatives and we have the chance to support them.

Now, if only Apple weren't taking 30% of all App Store sales and subscriptions.
