Publishing content is difficult. Well, that's not true. In fact, publishing content on the internet is extremely easyâ€”there are countless websites where one can sign up for a _free_ account and publish just about _anything_ for the masses to consume. If anything, publishing content couldn't be easier.   

But I'm not referring to the difficulty in publishing content on the internet, but rather, the cognitive leaps creators jump through while taking a creation from idea to fruition.  

Getting creations from a state of revising to a state of completion is where I've struggled the most as a writer. It's all too easy to fall down the [One More Thing](/one-more-thing) rabbit hole, continually [moving the goal posts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts) as I ferociously edit my work. 

Convincing myself that just because improvements _can_ be made doesn't mean that they _must_ be made has been difficult.

In a recent conversation with my life coach, [David Schlussel](https://yogilifecoach.com/), it struck me that an approach I could take towards facilitating my content publishing is to begin sharing drafts of my writing with the public. If I have internal barriers around sharing things that I feel are "incomplete" or "not ready," then I can label them as such and kick them out the door. Perhaps they will still provide some insight for folks or provide an opportunity for feedback from readers.

Publishing drafts feels like a good step in the direction of sharing more content with the world. It provides momentum, which keeps me motivated and engaged, fueling my creativity.

Here's to more writing and more publishing!
