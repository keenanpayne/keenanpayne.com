---

I recently took a [six-month sabbatical from freelancing](/goodbye-freelancing/) to ease some underlying anxiety and stress I've been experiencing in my life. This was *desperately* needed and I greatly enjoyed having some time to decompress and reflect.

I've actually been back to work since February. My new client project is keeping me pretty busy, though not so busy that I couldn't get this published sooner. Writing life updates always takes longer than expected, it seems.

Alright, let's get into what I've been up to and where I'm headed.

## I'm stressed, man.

My relationship with stress has changed *a lot* as I've gotten older. The more responsibilities I've gained and the better I understand the world, the more stressed I've become.

This undercurrent of stress has made me feel more anxious and uneasy in my day-to-day life. My capacity for optimism has slowly dwindled as I feel a greater weight on my shoulders and view the world through a more nuanced and critical lens. [^1]

[^1]: Knowledge is power?
  
Paradoxically, the older I've become, the *better* my life has objectively become:

- I have a successful career
- I met the love of my life
- I've made lots of money
- I have a significant amount of freedom and autonomy in my day-to-day life

So why the stress?

### Global and local stress

To reduce my stress, I needed to understand it. As I identified different stressors in my life, I began grouping them into two buckets, "global stress" and "local stress".

#### Global stress

Global stress we experience together:

- *Countless* global emergencies (e.g., climate change, pandemics, war)
- Corrupt politics
- The oppressing wave of late-stage capitalism
- Destroying the only planet we have to inhabit
- Income inequality

{% include type/note.html content: 'With global stress, I feel like I have little control over the outcome of my actions.' %}

There's only so much one person can do to improve the state of global stressors ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

I do what I can through political activism, awareness, and volunteering, but I'm a tiny piece of a massive puzzle.

I'm trying to stay productively focused on global issues while not letting them overrun my life.

**aka: no more mindless [doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) and unproductive YouTube binges.**
#### Local stress

I spent a significant amount of my time during my sabbatical reflecting on my local stressors.

Local stress is largely contained to my life and relationships:

- My career
- Financial wellbeing
- Family/relationship wellbeing
- Mental wellness
- Physical fitness
- Personal satisfaction
- Work/life balance

{% include type/note.html content: 'With local stress, I feel empowered to change my circumstances however I prefer.' %}

I wanted to bring these into focus to understand how I could reduce my anxiety and improve my day-to-day happiness. 

The local stressors I ended up focusing on were my relationship with *my career* and *money*. 

## The freelancing grind

After returning to [freelancing in 2019](/goodbye-asana-hello-freelancing/), I had clients as far as the eye can see. This was thanks to the extensive network of friends and colleagues I met during my first decade working. Among these were folks from Asana, as well as previous clients and collaborators I'd worked with over the years.

**I accepted client after client, juggling multiple projects at once. On average, I launched a client project every 36 days!**

To make my life easier‚Äîsince I had deliberately made it *harder* by accepting so many clients‚ÄîI hired some buddies to lend a helping hand (shout out to [Jamie](https://jaime.one) and Nels ‚úåÔ∏è)

{% include type/p_large.html, content: "Suddenly, I was not only a freelance web developer, but also a project manager and a people manager." %}

Managing the planning and execution of everything was exhausting and stressful. Each project had different goals, different stakeholders, and a different process for how we would complete the project. 

Meeting the demand of my client projects while balancing all other areas of life took its toll. I was feeling stressed, overwhelmed, and anxious. I *frequently* felt like I was teetering on the edge of anxiety attacks while working.

My increasingly anxious state made me resentful toward my life circumstances. 

Instead of viewing my career as an _opportunity_, rife with abundance and pleasure, I viewed it as a _burden_.

## Burnout... again.

All of this led me to burnout.

I won‚Äôt go deep into my experience with burnout in this post, but it‚Äôs something I want to talk about more in the future. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve experienced severe burnout a couple of times during my career. It sucks.

{% include type/p_large.html, content: "Burnout is something that can happen to anyone in any profession at any time under any circumstances. It‚Äôs a serious problem for folks experiencing it." %}

Ultimately, I was battling negative feedback loops that impacted my ability to enjoy life: 

- Mindlessly accepting too many client projects
- Orienting my career and my contentment around money and wealth
- Sticking to work that I could comfortably complete quickly, rather than work that would push me to grow
- Not pushing myself to grow in meaningful ways

During the past two years I've succeeded in some ways but failed in others.

I've succeeded in things that are overwhelmingly stressful (managing multiple projects and optimizing my work around money).

I've failed in things that would be enjoyable (working on a single client and optimizing my work aound enjoyment/growth).

I wasn't enjoying life.

## Off the grind

I needed time to decompress, so I took a sabbatical. It was time to prioritize my mental health and wellbeing above work and money.

I did a lot during my six months away from work:
- I spent a lot of time with my girlfriend Elaine, who just finished her master's degree and also lacked professional obligations for the foreseeable future.
- I reflected and identified stressors in my life and tried to alleviate them to the best of my abilities.
- I reoriented myself around what I value, rather than what I've been conditioned to value.
- I spent time engaged in intrinsically enjoyable activities such as writing, learning, reading, hiking, and creating (i.e., [my practices](/practices/)).
- I remained intensely focused on addressing my chronic back pain through regular chiropractic sessions at [PostureWorks](https://posture-works.com/) and my daily yoga practice.

This was all tremendously beneficial. 

My anxiety has reduced dramatically, though it remains an ongoing battle. My body feels *much* better. I feel more connected with myself and the world. I feel re-energized and motivated.

**I'm so grateful I was privilged enough to take a six-month sabbatical üôèüèª**

## Gaining clarity

I don‚Äôt hate web development, nor do I dislike using my skills as a web developer to build things for others. In fact, I love both of these things! This is why I became a web developer in the first place.

What I hate are the __circumstances I created for myself__. 

Why I was working, how I was working, what I was working on, and who I was working with were not providing me with a healthy working environment.

{% include type/question.html, content: "If I still love web development and I still enjoy building products with and for other people, how can I change my circumstances to avoid anxiety and burnout?" %}

Asking this question helped me _flip the script_.

### Too many client projects

I realized that juggling multiple client projects and outsourcing development work isn‚Äôt my cup of tea. This requires way too much client, people, and project management. [^3]

[^3]: To my credit, I think I've become a pretty decent manager in the past few years. But I don‚Äôt want to be a _manager_‚ÄîI want to be a _developer_.

#### Too many questions

Why have I felt the need to accept so many client projects? 

What's wrong with working on a single project at a time? 

Do I think client projects are [scarce](/hello-scarcity-mindset/), therefore I better feast while I can?

How much is required to feast?

<hr class="-fancy" />

Questioning my actions helped me uncover my motives and predispositions. I learned more about myself and why I was on the path that I was on.

I realized a few things:

- I'm not immediately interested in building a creative studio or managing anything larger than myself
- I can afford to live working on a single project at a time
- I can always scale up if I want or need to

These realizations helped me decide to work on only a single project at a time.

I can work on a project I'm passionate about and put 100% of my professional energy into it.

That sounds great.

### Finding the right challenge

I got into a groove working on projects with similar clients, stakeholders, problem domains, and technology stacks. This groove helped me carve out a niche for myself as a marketing website developer.

As I found my groove, I worked on bigger projects with larger budgets for more prestigious clients. This was only possible because of how much time I invested in a single area.

The problem with finding my groove is that my work became monotonous. Despite my efficiency and the increased scale of my work, I found my work uninspiring. 

After ten years of focusing my efforts building marketing websites, I decided it was time to change things up. Not only was I overwhelmed with the amount of work I had been doing before my sabbatical, but I was *overwhelmingly bored* with it.

{% include type/p_large.html, content: "I'm reorienting my career as a web developer by sinking my teeth into new technologies and problems." %}
## New work, new me.

I turned my realizations into convictions as I redesigned my professional life.

- I will no longer optimize my career around making the most money I possibly can
- I will no longer optimize my career around doing the same type of work because I can easily do it
- I will only accept client projects that challenge me in compelling ways
- I will only work with stakeholders who are good collaborators

Affirming these helped me confront what's been holding me back.

Having clarity provided a guiding light to move forward.

### Back in the arena

I suddenly felt ready to get back to work, but in a way that worked with me, not against me.

As luck would have it, shortly after I decided the path I wanted to take my professional career, the folks from [Stable Auto](https://stable.auto/) reached out about collaborating.

The job? Frontend architect tasked with rebuilding a web application to meet the increasing needs of the company's customers while providing a solid technical foundation for future growth.

**I would be challenged with a codebase, technology stack, and problem domain that I was entirely unfamiliar with.**

Game on.

I've been working on this project for a few months and *I've been busy*. I'm knee-deep learning new technologies to address the problem at hand. In doing so, I've found myself challenged in ways that are invigorating and rewarding, rather than stressful and anxiety-inducing.

## Moving forward

There's more I'd like to dive into as I think about my experience with burnout, anxiety, stress, and overwhelm. I also think there's a lot to say about the cultural indoctrination that can happen in societies where so much of what we're taught to value revolves around money.

But I've gone on long enough for today. Now you know where I've been, where I'm at, and where I'm headed.

I'm trying to keep a better eye on my mental health in the future so I can address things *proactively*, rather than *reactively*. I don't want burnout and anxiety attacks to be the sign that I need to switch things up again.

To anyone who's experienced or is currently experiencing the same thing, I encourage you to reach out to others to share what you're going through. This is something I wish I had done more during the past couple of years. 

**My propensity for independence works against me when I'm keeping things bottled up in myself.**
