I recently took a [six-month sabbatical from freelancing](/goodbye-freelancing/) to ease some underlying anxiety and stress I've been experiencing in my life. Now I'm back and ready to share what I've been up to and where things are headed in my life.

## Global stress

Things have been stressful recently. Hasn't life been stressful for everyone&hellip;always? I'm certainly not unique in thi regard.

But my relationship with stress and the ways I experience it have changed as I've gotten older. It feels like there are **so many** things to be constantly stressed about.

We're combatting *countless* global emergencies, our politics is rife our with corruption, we're riding an oppressing wave of late-stage capitalism, and we're collectively destroying the only planet we have to inhabit. Yay.

I call this "global stress", since these stressers aren't contained to just my life. These are something we are all experiencing together.

## Local stress

Atop the global stress is the local stress. These are the stressers that are generally contained to me and those who I'm closest to.

I began [freelancing in 2019](/goodbye-asana-hello-freelancing/) and hit the ground running. I had clients as far as the eye can see. And I capitalized on it big time.

On average, I launched a client project every 36 days! Whew. I was managing multiple clients and I hired contractors to help move things forward on multiple fronts. Each project had different goals, different stakeholders, and a different process for how we would complete the project. **It was exhausting.**

Meeting the demand of my client projects while balancing all other areas of life took its toll. I was feeling stressed and overwhelmed, which manifested as [generalized anxiety](((POyhwqaZ9))). I *frequently* felt like I was teetering on the edge of anxiety attacks while working.

My increasingly anxious state made me resentful toward my life circumstances. Instead of viewing my career as an _opportunity_, rife with abundance and pleasure, I viewed it as a _burden_. It sucked.

This is largely how my work continued for almost two years. I took vacations and breaks, so I didn't have my nose to the grindstone nonstop. But when I was working, *I was working*. I was on the grind.

## Burnout... again.

The compounding negativity and anxiety I experienced led me to burnout.

I won‚Äôt go deep into my experience with burnout in this post, but it‚Äôs something I want to talk about more in the future. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve experienced severe burnout multiple times during my career and it sucks.

{% include type/p_large.html, content: "Burnout is something that can happen to anyone in any profession at any time under any circumstances. It‚Äôs a serious problem." %}

Ultimately, I was battling negative feedback loops that impacted my ability to enjoy life: 

- Mindlessly accepting too many client projects
- Orienting my career and my contentment around money and wealth
- Sticking to work that I could comfortably complete, rather than work that would push me to grow

What happens when you can't enjoy life? You get burnt out.

## Off the grind

I needed time to decompress, so I took a sabbatical. It was time to prioritize my mental health and wellbeing above work and money.

I did a lot during my six months away from work:
- I spent a lot of time with my girlfriend Elaine, who just finished her master's degree and also lacked professional obligations for the foreseeable future.
- I reflected and identified stressers in my life and tried to alleviate them to the best of my abilities.
- I re-oriented myself around what I value, rather than what I've been conditioned to value.
- I spent time engaged in intrinsically enjoyable activities such as writing, learning, reading, hiking, and creating (i.e., [my practices](/practices/)).
- I remained intensely focused on addressing my chronic back pain through regular chiropractic sessions at [PostureWorks](TODO: ADD LINK) and my daily yoga practice.

This was all tremendously beneficial. My anxiety reduced dramatically, though it remains an ongoing battle. My body felt better. I felt more connected with myself and the world. I felt re-energized and motivated again. 

**I'm so incredibly grateful I'm privilged enough to be able to take a six month sabbatical üôèüèª**

## Gaining clarity

I don‚Äôt hate web development, nor do I dislike using my skills as a web developer to build things for others. In fact, I love both of these things! It's why I wanted to become a web developer in the first place.

What I hate are the __circumstances I created for myself__. Why I was working, how I was working, what I was working on, and who I was working with were not providing me with a healthy working environment.

{% include type/question.html, content: "If I still love web development and I still enjoy building products with and for other people, how can I change my circumstances to avoid anxiety and burnout?" %}

Asking this question helped me _flip the script_.

### Too many client projects

I realized that juggling multiple client projects and outsourcing development work isn‚Äôt my cup of tea. This requires way too much client, people, and project management. [^1]

[^1]: To my credit, I think I've become a pretty decent manager in the past few years. But I don‚Äôt want to be a _manager_‚ÄîI want to be a _developer_.

Why have I felt the need to accept so many client projects? What's wrong with working on a single project at a time? Is it because I think client projects are [scarce](/hello-scarcity-mindset/), and therefore I better feast while I can?

**How much is required for one to feast?**

I'm not immediately interested in building a creative studio or managing anything larger than myself for the time being. This means I don't need to work multiple client projects. 

Instead, I can work on a single project at a time that I'm passionate about and put 100% of my professional energy into it.

### Finding the right challenge

After ten years of focusing my web development efforts building marketing websites, I decided it was time to change things up. Not only was I overwhelmed with the amount of work I had been doing before my sabbatical, but I was *overwhelmingly bored* with it.

I got into a groove working on projects with similar clients, stakeholders, problem domains, and technology stacks.

This groove helped me carve out a niche for myself as a web developer who specializes in building marketing websites and I got really fucking good at it. I worked efficiently and reliably. 

Building standard marketing websites required little effort because of my proficiency, which enabled me to juggle more than one project and work on projects of increasing scope and complexity.

Even as I specialized I was able to challenge myself. My increasing proficiency allowed me to work on projects of ever-increasing size and complexity. Project budgets were *way* higher. I could juggle multiple projects at once without dropping too many balls.

{% include type/p_large.html, content: "I was being challenged as a project and people manager, not a web developer." %}

I wanted to re-orient my career to challange myself as a web developer, not a manager. I wanted to sink my teeth into new technologies and solve new problems for different stakeholders. 

**I will no longer needlessly optimize my career around doing the same type of work, simply because I‚Äôm good at it.**

## New work, new me.

These realizations turned into convictions as I redesigned my professional life. I felt ready to revive my career, but in a way that worked with me, not against me.

And as luck would have it, shortly after I decided the path I wanted to take my professional career, the folks from [Stable Auto](https://stable.auto/) reached out about collaborating.

The job? Frontend architect helping rebuild an entire web application to meet the increasing needs of their customers while providing a solid foundation for future growth.

I've been working on this project for a few months and I'm staying busy, hence the delayed publication of this blog post. 

What's lovely is that now I'm busy and challenged in ways that are invigorating and rewarding, rather than stressful and anxiety-inducing. I still get moments of stress and anxiety, especially given how many things I have to learn and implement on the fly, but these feelings are much less severe than they were last year and I'm finding myself in an increasingly positive headspace more frequently.

## Moving forward

There's so much more I want to dive into as I think about my experience with burnout, anxiety, stress, and overwhelm. I also think there's a lot to say about the cultural indoctrination that can happen in capitalist societies where so much of what we're told to value revolves around money.

But I've gone on long enough for one blog post. Now you know where I've been, where I'm at, and where I'm headed.

I want to keep a better eye on my mental health in the future and try to address things *proactively*, rather than *reactively*. I don't want burnout and anxiety attacks to be the sign that I need to switch things up again.

To anyone who's experienced or is currently experiencing the same thing, I encourage you to reach out to others to share what you're going through. This is something I wish I had done more during the past couple of years. My propensity for independence works against me when I'm keeping things bottled up in myself.
