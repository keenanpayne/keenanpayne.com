I just started following [Jim Nielson's blog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/) after listening to [this wonderful Shoptalk interview](https://shoptalkshow.com/504/) and was inspired by how he [shares](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/reading-notes-february/) what he's been reading throughout the month. I love this idea!

It can be hard to discern signal from noise in an era of media abundance. Something new is published every second—blog posts, books, essays, videos, podcasts, tweets, photos—you get the idea. My favorite way of finding new content to consume is from recommendations by people I trust or admire, hence my enjoyment of Jim's posts.

Because sharing is fun and potentially helpful, I want to share what I'm learning every month, highlighting the most impactful content I've consumed. Here's to more signal and less noise!

## Book: The Power of Now

The Power of Now has been an incredibly impactful read after struggling with anxiety, stress, and overwhelm during the past few years. Eckhart Tolle's conversational style of writing on topics such as mindfulness, consciousness, self-awareness, and spirituality are more akin to receiving heartfelt advice from a friend, not dictates from a self-help guru. The book is also easy to read in short spurts, making it the perfect companion when I'm experiencing moments of high anxiety.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "Happiness may be perceived as a heightened sense of aliveness attained through physical pleasure, or a more secure and more complete sense of self attained through some form of psychological gratification. This is the search for salvation from a state of unsatisfactoriness or insufficiency. Invariably, any satisfaction that they obtain is short-lived, so the condition of satisfaction or fulfillment is usually projected once again onto an imaginary point away from the here and now. “When I obtain <em>this</em> or am free of <em>that</em> — then I will be okay.”" %}
