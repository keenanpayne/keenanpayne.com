I just started following [Jim Nielson's blog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/) after listening to [this wonderful Shoptalk interview](https://shoptalkshow.com/504/). I was inspired by how he [shares](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/reading-notes-february/) what he's been reading throughout the month. I love this idea!

It can be hard to discern signal from noise in an era of media abundance. Something new is published every second—blog posts, books, essays, videos, podcasts, tweets, photos, etc. My favorite way of finding potentially impactful new content to consume is through recommendations by people I trust or admire, hence my enjoyment of Jim's posts (and the Shoptalk Show, for that matter).

Because sharing is fun and potentially useful for others, I want to share what I'm learning every month by highlighting the most impactful content I've consumed. Here's to more signal and less noise!

## Book: The Power of Now

The Power of Now has been an incredibly impactful read after struggling with anxiety, stress, and overwhelm during the past few years. Eckhart Tolle's conversational style of writing on topics such as mindfulness, consciousness, self-awareness, and spirituality are more akin to receiving heartfelt advice from a friend, not dictates from a self-help guru. The book is also easy to read in short spurts, making it the perfect companion when I'm experiencing moments of high anxiety.

## Article: [My first impressions of web3](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html)

In the span of six months, I've fallen into and climbed out of the cryptocurrency/web3/NFT rabbit hole. I went __deep__. I "invested" in coins and NFTs, involved myself in various crypto communities (primarily as a lurker), and spent __a lot__ of time learning about the underlying blockchain technology. 

The time I spent investigating the underlying technology paved the way for my losing interest in crypto. I now see it as __much__ more detrimental than beneficial. This article by Moxie Marlinspike, creator of Signal, really put the nail in the coffin for my interest. He outlines how purportedly "decentralized" platforms work, why such platforms aren't truly decentralized, and why decentralization may not even be an ideal outcome for a rapidly evolving ecosystem.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "If something is truly decentralized, it becomes very difficult to change, and often remains stuck in time. That is a problem for technology, because the rest of the ecosystem is moving very quickly, and if you don’t keep up you will fail." %}

## Podcast: [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes)

I recently found out about the Command Line Heroes podcast, and it quickly became my favorite show to binge. In it, host Saron Yitbarek shares stories on computing, software, and technology. The show is well-researched, concise, and contains interviews with countless developers, programmers, and hackers. 

## Book: [Several Short Sentences About Writing]()

Several Short Sentences About Writing is changing the way I write. I never realized how bloated my sentences were until I started reading this book. If you're a writer, do yourself a favor and read this book.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "Every word in a sentence is optional until it proves to be essential." %}

## Course: [Next.js Firebase Social Blogging Platform](https://fireship.io/courses/react-next-firebase/)

I recently accepted my first client project after taking a lovely six-month sabbatical. The project I've accepted is a bit outside of my wheelhouse, however. Instead of building marketing websites for clients, I'm working on a React.js/TypeScript/Firebase web application. How exciting!

Having never using these technologies in a real-world project, I needed to get up to speed __quickly__. I worked through a few tutorials before eventually stumbling on this course, offered by Jeff Delaney, creator and author of the immensely popular YouTube channel and course platform [Fireship.io]. Boy, am I happy I found this course when I did. I was able to learn these technologies quickly all while building a fun web application.
