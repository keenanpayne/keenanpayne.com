For over ten years, I've had some semblance of direction in my life, stewarding my ship towards achieving financial security. Not knowing where this might manifest, I followed every lead I could, searching for a paycheck like a drug dog sniffs luggage. Good work, [capitalism](/tags/capitalism).

Thirteen years of work and plenty of good luck have helped fulfill my capitalist desires—food is on the table, rent is covered, and the future contains a decent degree of financial certainty. I'm extraordinarily grateful for this. This good fortune has allowed me to take a break from my career as a freelance web developer for some time as I pursue different passions.

This transition has been odd, though. I've found myself with a paradoxical sense of uncertainty in my newfound certainty.

Amusingly, my uncertainty reminds me of Chuck Noland, the character played by Tom Hanks in the 2000 film, [Castaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_Away). In the movie, Noland becomes stranded on an island for four years following a plane crash. He maintains some degree of sanity by remembering his girlfriend, befriending an uninspiringly-named volleyball, and safeguarding a washed-up package he refuses to open. Upon his rescue, Noland learns that the world has moved on without him, assuming his death following the crash. His girlfriend is married and has a child, he no longer has his volleyball, and he delivers the safeguarded package to its intended recipient. [^1]

Stripped of what made life meaningful before and after the crash, Noland reaches a crossroads—unsure where to go and what to do.

With the driving force behind my actions in life obviated, I feel unsure of what might come next. Having boundless energy, enthusiasm, and interests makes this transition easier. I'm grateful that I have so many areas where I enjoy spending time. 

Still, I've struggled to avoid a state of ennui, lost in the stranded island of my head as the motivations behind my actions fade in and out of view.

All I can do is continue charting my path forward. I will use this time to explore different facets of my being, spend time with people I love, and continue learning and growing. 

Let's see where life takes me.
