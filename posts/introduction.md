Hello, my name is Keenan Payne, which you probably already discerned if you're reading this post. If you haven't, greetings it's nice to meet you. üëãüèª

I'm starting this blog with the intention of sharing any helpful knowledge that I have as it pertains to coding (Maybe I'll branch out in the future). I've always found writing to be a helpful exercise in both teaching and learning. By spending time writing, I get to share my thoughts and ideas with you on a given subject, but I also get to spend time re-evaluating my thoughts and ideas. This cycle of re-evaluation helps me think of things that I might otherwise have missed initially. It also gives me the space to think of alternatives and ensure that I'm providing you, the reader, my best thoughts at any given time on a subject.

### Topics of Conversation

What exactly will I be talking about? Well, by profession I'm a front-end developer so I'll be sharing plenty of thoughts on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This might manifest itself in the form of in-depth tutorials, quick tips, helpful hacks, analysis, and more.

I'm lucky enough to work on different projects on a daily basis, always solving challenges that arise. If it takes me more than an hour to solve a single problem, then it's deserving of a blog post. Additionally, my solutions are almost guaranteed to be sub-optimal, which is why I have a comments box for each post. I would love nothing more than to engage in civil discourse with other developers in an effort to hear new opinions and learn how other developers might solve a given problem.

Outside of my daily work, I'm also sporadically involved in different open source projects. These include tools for developers (i.e., [Concise](https://concisecss.com/)), or what I believe to be useful websites (coming soon - üòÆ). These projects grant me the opportunity to work with new technologies, and to take a stab at making the life of my fellow developers easier.

{% include type/p_large.html, content: "As I start to work on new projects, I think that this blog would be a perfect outlet for outlining the work that I'm doing, how I'm doing it, and why." %}

I'm looking forward to getting the chance to write more and share what I can with you. I hope you follow along with this blog and share your thoughts as you find appropriate.
