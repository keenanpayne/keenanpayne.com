## Book: [The Practice: Shipping Creative Work](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593328972)

[Last month](/april-2022-learning/) I was reading *The Icarus Deception* by Seth Godin. Now, I'm working through *The Practice*. I frequently fall back on the wisdom shared in Seth's writing when I feel stuck in my creative endeavors.

{% include "type/blockquote.html", content: "Working in anticipation of what we‚Äôll get in return takes us out of the world of self-trust and back into the never-ending search for reassurance and the perfect outcome. We believe that we need a guarantee, and that the only way to get that guarantee is with external feedback and results. It draws our eye to the mirror instead of the work.", author: "Seth Godin" %}

Seth's framing of creative endeavors as "[practices](/tags/practices)" is something [I've discussed before](/practices/). It's a frame that's been incredibly useful in helping orient my actions around intrinsically enjoyable activities rather than the outcomes associated with my actions.

## Book: [Creative Visualization](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781608684649)

I began reading Creative Visualization [last month](/april-2022-learning/), and I continue to find it inspiring and applicable as I design my ideal post-sabbatical working environment. 

{% include "type/blockquote.html", content: "To create prosperity, we need to visualize ourselves living as we desire to live, doing what we love, feeling satisfied with what we attain, and in a context of other people doing the same.", author: "Shakti Gawain" %}

{% include "type/tip.html", content: "Using visualization out of fear of the negative outcomes that might occur if we don't reach our goals is counter-productive. We end up energizing our fear of failure more than our desire for success." %}

## Article: [In the Dark](https://restofworld.org/2022/blackouts/)

This essay discusses how the civil unrest that arose out of the [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring) in 2011 opened the door for increased political censorship of the internet by oppressive regimes across the world.

I highly recommend reading this article if you want a deep dive into online censorship technologies employed by authoritarian regimes across the world.

{% include "type/blockquote.html", content: "Russia is a pioneer in the use of [internet censorship] tools but not an outlier. The technologies it uses are proliferating, creeping into internet infrastructure all over the world, helped by multinational companies that have turned censorship into an off-the-shelf product." %}

I loved the art direction of this essay. In particular, I enjoyed the web animations implemented for images using CSS. I dove through the source code for the essay and turned these animations into a [CodePen example](https://codepen.io/keenanpayne/pen/rNJjapZ/5d4f012df0610638651b5c4053a6c4f7?editors=1100) to learn how they implemented them.

## Podcast: [Shoptalk Show 516 ‚Äî Shipping creative work and "Twitter-driven development"](https://shoptalkshow.com/516/)

Shoptalk Show is one of my favorite web development podcasts. Web dev veterans [Chris Coyier](http://chriscoyier.net) and [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com) host the show each week as they discuss what's happening in the world of web development, projects that they're working on, issues they've encountered, and more.

Episode 516 was a standout episode for me. The subject of shipping creative work and "Twitter-driven development" inspired a slew of thoughts. I captured these in a Twitter thread which you can read by clicking the tweet below or checking out the essay on [this Typefully post](https://typefully.com/KeenanPayne_/shoptalk-show-516-shipping-creative-work-and-Q9oMR2p).

## Podcast: [The Growth Equation ‚Äî Doing real things, satisfaction, practices, and momentum](https://thegrowtheq.com/do-more-real-things-in-the-world-be-better-and-feel-better/)

Another podcast I enjoy is The Growth Equation, hosted by Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness. Each episode features these two talking about personal performance and sustainable success.

This episode struck a chord as I began thinking about the importance of doing "real things" in the world. I captured these in a Twitter thread, which you can read by clicking the Tweet below. You can also read the full essay on [this Typefully post](https://typefully.com/KeenanPayne_/JlDHqXy).
