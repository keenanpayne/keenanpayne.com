While reflecting on what I want to learn during the upcoming year, I started devising a set of questions to ask myself before deciding to learn something new. I intend to be more intentional by answering these questions without removing the opportunity for serendipity.

{% include "type/p_large.html", content: "With so many things to potentially learn, having clarity on <em>what</em> I want to learn and <em>why</em> feels nice." %}

{% include "type/question.html", content: "Do I want my exploration of <strong>[subject]</strong> to be free-flowing (i.e., learning, exploring, discovering as I go), or would I prefer more guidance?" %}

{% include "type/question.html", content: "Which of my <a href='/practices' title='Turning activities into practices'>practices</a> am I hoping to engage by learning more about <strong>[subject]</strong>?" %}

{% include "type/question.html", content: "What might more knowledge about <strong>[subject]</strong> help with? Are there any relevant projects that would benefit?" %}

{% include "type/question.html", content: "Is there any outcome that I am striving to achieve by learning more about <strong>[subject]</strong>?" %}

{% include "type/question.html", content: "What resources do I already own or have I already collected that might serve as a jumping-off point for learning more about <strong>[subject]</strong>?" %}

How do you decide what to learn?
