Boy, do I walk fast. It's as if the only thing that matters is getting from point A to point B. I feel built to move quickly. My long legs give me a stride designed for efficiency. Efficiency to... walk.

I'm not aware of my stride most of the time. No, I'm just doing my thing without a care in the world. It's usually on lackadaisical walkabouts where I find myself questioning the speed at which I propel myself through the world. I slow down; I feel weird. Why am I walking so slow?

But it's nice. I enjoy the stroll, and I notice my body loosen up. Now I'm going with the flow.

I embrace my saunter, and in doing so, I notice the gait of others. Observing my fast-moving compatriots, I feel outpaced. 

Am I getting left behind?

I get distracted—lost in thought or looking at my phone—and once again, I'm full-speed ahead. It must be a pattern.

And so I go, ebbing and flowing, arriving at my destination regardless of what stride I choose.
