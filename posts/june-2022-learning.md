## Video: [Hamming, Learning to Learn: You and Your Research, 6 June 1995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3msMuwqp-o)

By far the most impactful thing I watched was this video from person/Richard Hamming, an American mathematician whose work helped advance the fields of computer engineering and telecommunications. [*]person/Richard Hamming was an American mathematician whose work helped advance the fields of computer engineering and telecommunications. )  

This video marks the end of a lecture series given by Hamming to the Naval Postgraduate School and is designed to teach young officers how to learn and think. In it, Hamming discusses the importance of spending one's time doing significant work, spending time in meaningful ways, how to choose what to work on, among other things.   

You don't need to be a computer scientist or mathematician to find inspiration in what Hamming has to offer. If you want to make an impact in any domain, or, like me, you find yourself questioning where and how to spend your time, I highly suggest giving this a watch.

[An Olympic Trainer Shares His Top Secrets for Pushing Through Discomfort](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a40299457/steve-magness-do-hard-things/) 

[Last month](Blog Post: Learning Notes, May 2022), I shared a podcast I'd listened to from podcast/The Growth Equation, which is hosted by person/Brad Stulberg and person/Steve Magness. This month, I read a great article from Steve sharing his top advice for managing and pushing through [discomfort](Comfort/Discomfort).  

As I've [rebooted my freelancing career](Blog Post: Rebooting My Freelancing Career), I'm striving to pay closer attention to my levels of [comfort and discomfort](Comfort/Discomfort). I want to be comfortable enough so I'm not [overwhelmed](Overwhelm) and [anxious](Anxiety), but uncomfortable enough to encourage growth (i.e., [desirable difficulties](Desirable Difficulty)). I'm also improving my ability to manage my discomfort so I can navigate difficult situations with greater ease and satisfaction.   

Anything that makes you feel uncomfortable is an opportunity to desensitize the alarm in your brain. It’s not the discomfort that matters, it’s how you respond to it. note/Highlight Comfort/Discomfort

I recently found this court ruling between eyeo, a developer in ad-filtering technology, and Axel Springer, a German multi

This court case revolved around who "owns" the underlying code for things distributed across the internet (e.g., websites, email). When you receive your Morning Brew newsletter, who owns the underlying code once the email is delivered to you—you or Axel Springer? When you view an article on Business Insider, does Axel Springer "own" the entirety of the code even once it's delivered to your web browser?   

Axel Springer affirmed that any HTML used to render a website could be protected under copyright law. If this were the case, using ad-blockers, website translators, stylesheet modifications, and all manner of web browser extensions to alter the appearance of a website would be illegal.  

Obviously, this is a _massive_ overstep from Axel Springer, who obviously seeking to do little more than protect their advertising revenue by going after eyeo. Claiming full ownership over the underlying code for a website not only stands contrary to the principle mission of the internet and the W3C, the international standards body which defines the HTML specification.   

“This legal argument simply went too far. HTML is a widely adopted open standard that underpins most websites, and shifting the burden of permission to users and developers is clearly unreasonable. We are pleased that the Court agrees, and we feel honored and privileged to be able to take up this legal fight on behalf of the interests of all Internet participants everywhere. This decision also preempts needless court battles elsewhere,” said Kai Recke, General Counsel for eyeo. note/Highlight

This essay by Mark Fisher is prescient, given our fractured societal landscape. It's me against you; left vs. right; correct vs. incorrect as we fight for our beliefs and ideals in our polarizing world.   

Lost in this fervent battle for our ideals is the practicality of building solidarity and comradeship between groups of people to achieve common goals. While you and I might disagree on _some things_, we can also agree on _other things_. Go figure.

Of course there are lots of legitimate reasons to monetize, and creators deserve to be compensated. It’s not about people trying to make a buck. It’s about those treating the web simply as a market to run get-rich-quick schemes in, exploiting others out of pure greed. note/Highlight  

article/103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known  

This article by Kevin Kelly, a co-founder of Wired magazine, provides _countless_ bits of life advice that resonate with me. I highly suggest giving it a read and finding some insight and inspiration.   

The consistency of your endeavors (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity. Nothing beats small things done every day, which is way more important than what you do occasionally.

I'm continuing to work through The Icarus Deception, which I started in [April](Blog Post: Learning Notes, April 2022).   

The [opportunity](Creating and Finding Opportunities) isn't in being momentarily popular to the anonymous masses, it's in being missed when you're gone and doing work that matters for the tribe that you choose. note/Highlight My inspiration My Content Creation practice Community | Audience Building

[Fail Better: Embracing Failure](https://pca.st/PR77) 

I've listened to yet another wonderful episode of podcast/Command Line Heroes which discusses the value of embracing failure.   

Embracing failure isn't easy, but it's inevitable. Something will _always_ unexpectedly go wrong, even with the most rigorous, well-thought-out plans. Given this inevitability, planning for perfection is unrealistic and unhelpful. If we embrace the inevitability of failure, we can prepare ourselves to handle it in a healthy way that helps us learn and grow. [*][Failure](Success/Failure) is inevitable. Therefore, hoping to achieve no failure is unproductive. Instead, embracing that failure will happen and preparing oneself for handling that failure is how we learn and grow. note/Reminder)  

[Failure](Success/Failure) is inevitable, but you never want to fail the same way twice. note/Highlight note/Reminder  

Something that's helped me handle failure is keeping a tight feedback loop between identifying a problem and addressing the problem. When I encounter an opportunity to improve something in my life, I always consider whether I should take the time to make the improvement right away, rather than putting it on the back-burner. [*]Keeping a tight feedback loop between identifying a problem and [addressing the problem](Problem Solving) works well for maintaining systems long-term. When we see or encounter an opportunity for improvement, consider taking it! note/Reminder )  

[A Billion-Dollar Crypto Gaming Startup Promised Riches and Delivered Disaster](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-10/axie-infinity-axs-crypto-game-promised-nft-riches-gave-ruin) 

Great article on the fall of "play-to-earn" crypto "video game" Axie Infinity. Even as I fell down the crypto rabbit hole for a few months this summer, I couldn't concede to the notion that further financialization of video games would be good.   

A financial system consisting of people all hoping to put in $1 and take out $2 can last only as long as someone else shows up believing others will come in after them with more fistfuls of cash. note/Highlight   

book/Anything You Want  

I've enjoyed reading [Derek Sivers'](https://sive.rs) blog for a long time. His approachability, honesty, and down-to-earth writing style resonate with me. To support his writing, and my own learning, I [recently purchased](https://twitter.com/KeenanPayne_/status/1530688658851778561) hardcover copies of his books book/Anything You Want, book/Hell Yeah or No, and book/How to Live.   

In Anything You Want, Sivers shares his tales of building and selling CD Baby. There are practical lessons and fun anecdotes from this endeavor that I'm using as inspiration for my own business pursuits.   

When you make [a business] a dream come true for yourself, it'll be a dream come true for someone else, too. note/Highlight Business Development My inspiration  

As I read this book, I realize that something I've always enjoyed is [helping/mentoring/empowering](Mentorship) people with my own knowledge and experience. This is what underlies my desire to write and share. This is what has helped me get to where I'm at. I want to continue this cycle.   

book/How to Live  

By fully committing to something, we remove ourselves from participating in the never-ending desire for better alternatives. This saves time and energy by not inundating ourselves with thoughts about whether the grass is greener somewhere else.   

If you weren't dependent on income, people, or technology, you would be truly free. note/Highlight  

book/Hell Yeah or No  

If I don't respond with "Hell yeah!" to a decision or chance to do something, that indicates it's more likely a [distraction than an opportunity](Opportunities versus Distractions). note/Reminder
