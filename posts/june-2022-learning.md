## Video: [Hamming, Learning to Learn: You and Your Research, 6 June 1995](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3msMuwqp-o)

By far, the most impactful thing I watched this month was this video from Richard Hamming, an American mathematician whose work helped advance the fields of computer engineering and telecommunications.

This video marks the end of a lecture series Hamming gave to the Naval Postgraduate School. In it, Hamming discusses the importance of spending one's time doing significant work, spending time in meaningful ways, how to choose what to work on, among other things.

You don't need to be a computer scientist or mathematician to find inspiration in what Hamming offers. If you want to make an impact in any field—or, if you're like me, you find yourself questioning where and how to spend your time—I highly suggest giving this a watch.

## Article: [An Olympic Trainer Shares His Top Secrets for Pushing Through Discomfort](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a40299457/steve-magness-do-hard-things/) 

[Last month](/may-2022-learning/#podcast%3A-the-growth-equation-%E2%80%94-doing-real-things%2C-satisfaction%2C-practices%2C-and-momentum), I shared a podcast I'd listened to called [The Growth Equation](https://thegrowtheq.com/), hosted by Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness. This month, I read a great article from Steve sharing his top advice for managing and pushing through discomfort.

As I've [rebooted my freelancing career](/freelancing-reboot/), I'm striving to pay closer attention to my levels of comfort and discomfort. I want to be comfortable enough so I'm not overwhelmed and [anxious](/tags/anxiety/) but uncomfortable enough to encourage growth—i.e., focusing on [desirable difficulties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desirable_difficulty). I'm also improving my ability to manage my discomfort so I can navigate difficult situations with greater ease and satisfaction.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "Anything that makes you feel uncomfortable is an opportunity to desensitize the alarm in your brain. It’s not the discomfort that matters, it’s how you respond to it.", author: "Steve Magness" %}

## Article: [Make Free Stuff](https://mxb.dev/blog/make-free-stuff/)

I enjoyed Max Böck's thoughts on making free stuff. The ethos of publicly sharing on the internet helped fuel my interest in [web development](/tags/web-development/) in the mid-2000s. I learned from folks like [Chris at CSS-Tricks](/css-tricks/), who dedicated so much time into sharing their knowledge and experience.

I look up to these people.

Because giving something away for free—aka "gifting"—promotes a culture of abundance, not [scarcity](/hello-scarcity-mindset/). It's a gift to the world. 

You could have monetized, but you gifted.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "Of course there are lots of legitimate reasons to monetize, and creators deserve to be compensated. It’s not about people trying to make a buck. It’s about those treating the web simply as a market to run get-rich-quick schemes in, exploiting others out of pure greed.", author: "Max Böck" %}

I want to do a lot more gifting.

## Article: [Exiting the Vampire Castle](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/exiting-vampire-castle/)

This essay by Mark Fisher is prescient, given our fractured societal landscape. It's me vs. you; left vs. right; correct vs. incorrect, as we fight for our beliefs and ideals in our polarizing world.

Lost in the fervent battle for our ideals is the practicality of building solidarity and comradeship between different groups of people to achieve common goals.

While you and I might disagree on *some things*, we can also agree on *other things*. 

Moralistic browbeating and reactionary "cancelling" does little more than fracture potential coalitions while reinforcing a punitive moral framework. 

It's certainly not a path towards working-class solidarity and class consciousness, I'll tell you that.

Let's just work together where we can. Inevitably, nobody will agree on *everything*, but let's fight for agreements where we can. 

We need to work together if we're going to make meaningful societal and political change.

Who wants to build a coalition?

## Article: [103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/)

This article by Kevin Kelly, a co-founder of Wired magazine, provides _countless_ bits of life advice that resonate with me. I highly suggest giving it a read and finding some insight and inspiration.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "The consistency of your endeavors (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity. Nothing beats small things done every day, which is way more important than what you do occasionally." %}

## Article: [eyeo wins landmark copyright court decision; protects digital rights and sets important legal precedent for who ‘owns’ HTML](https://eyeo.com/press-release/eyeo-wins-landmark-copyright-court-decision-protects-digital-rights-and-sets)

I recently found this court ruling between eyeo and Axel Springer. eyeo is a developer in ad-filtering technology. Axel Springer is a multimedia conglomerate that owns Business Insider, Morning Brew newsletter, and more.

**This court case revolved around who "owns" the underlying code for things distributed across the internet (e.g., websites, email).**

{% include type/question.html, content: "When you receive your Morning Brew newsletter, who owns the underlying code once the email is delivered to your inbox—you or Axel Springer?" %}

{% include type/question.html, content: "When you view an article on Business Insider, does Axel Springer own the entirety of the code for that article after it's received by your web browser?" %}

Seemingly tricky questions. Who "owns" what, in these scenarios? 

The write-up from eyeo sums it up well:

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "While the website HTML copyright protections sought by the plaintiff appear innocent on the surface, the technical ramifications are onerous and dangerous. In practice, most of the modern browser features that the Internet ecosystem enjoys today would have become instantly illegal, and copyright sanctions would have become enforceable: all privacy and anti-tracking technologies; all website language translation features; all accessibility utilities for blind and handicapped readers; all ad blockers; and all CSS modifications of any kind. The burden would have fallen upon code developers and ordinary users to seek explicit permission from a website publisher to grant an exception to run their browser features — before visiting each and every website." %}

**TL;DR —** The enforceable boundary for copyright protection is where the code is provisioned, not where it is executed. 

So I own the code I write for the email you're receiving. But once I send this email to you and it arrives in your inbox, I no longer own it.

## Book: [The Icarus Deception](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781591846079)

I'm continuing to work through The Icarus Deception, which I started in [April](/april-2022-learning/).

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "The opportunity isn't in being momentarily popular to the anonymous masses, it's in being missed when you're gone and doing work that matters for the tribe that you choose." %}

{% include type/question.html, content: "Who do you want your customers/consumers/readers to change after they interact with you, your art, or whatever you've created?" %}

## Podcast: [Fail Better: Embracing Failure](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-2/fail-better) 

I've listened to [yet another](/march-2022-learning/) wonderful episode of Command Line Heroes which discusses the value of embracing failure.

Embracing failure isn't easy, but it's inevitable. Something will _always_ unexpectedly go wrong, even with the most rigorous, well-thought-out plans. 

Given this inevitability, planning for perfection is unrealistic and unhelpful. 

If we embrace the inevitability of failure, we can prepare ourselves to handle it in a healthy way that helps us learn and grow.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "Failure is inevitable, but you never want to fail the same way twice." %}

Something that's helped me handle failure is keeping a tight feedback loop between identifying a problem and addressing the problem. When I encounter an opportunity to improve something in my life, I always consider whether I should take the time to make the improvement right away, rather than putting it on the back-burner.

## Book: [Anything You Want](https://sive.rs/a)

I've enjoyed reading [Derek Sivers'](https://sive.rs) blog for a long time. His approachability, honesty, and down-to-earth writing style resonate with me. To support his writing, and my own learning, I [recently purchased](https://twitter.com/KeenanPayne_/status/1530688658851778561) hardcover copies of his books Anything You Want, Hell Yeah or No, and How to Live.

In Anything You Want, Sivers shares his tales of building and selling CD Baby. There are practical lessons and fun anecdotes from this endeavor that I'm using as inspiration for my own business pursuits.

{% include type/blockquote.html, content: "When you make [a business] a dream come true for yourself, it'll be a dream come true for someone else, too." %}

As I read this book, I realize that something I've always enjoyed is helping/mentoring/empowering people with my own knowledge and experience. This is what underlies my desire to write and share. This is what has helped me get to where I'm at. I want to continue this cycle.

## Book: [How to Live](https://sive.rs/h)

By fully committing to something, we remove ourselves from participating in the never-ending desire for better alternatives. This saves time and energy by not inundating ourselves with thoughts about whether the grass is greener somewhere else.

If you weren't dependent on income, people, or technology, you would be truly free. note/Highlight  

Book: [Hell Yeah or No](https://sive.rs/n)

If I don't respond with "Hell yeah!" to a decision or chance to do something, that indicates it's more likely a distraction than an opportunity.
