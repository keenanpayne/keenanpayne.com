The muse for a creative can serve as a wellspring from which all manner of inspiration pours, fueling the engine of creativity. It can also be an albatross to any creative who finds themselves beholden to their muse, despite their desire or attempt to harness its potential for creative output.   

How many muses have I let pass me by, blissfully unaware of their fleeting existence within the realm of my creative capabilities? Too many to count, I’m sure, so I’ll save myself the effort.  

I’ve become more aware of my relationship with my muses as I attempt to engage with a muse of the past, one that caught my attention so feverishly that my imagination ran wild at the realm of endless possibilities that lie ahead once I begin my pursuit of it. Well, _should_ I begin my pursuit of it, given the considerable time that has passed since my initial inspiration and my current state of paralysis that arises at the thought of actively engaging with it.   

While I sit at my desk — or stand, depending on how disciplined I’m feeling in maintaining the illusion that doing _anything_ at a desk for more than a couple of hours is an exercise in physical self-destruction (at least for my back) — I notice my inability to put pen to paper, to breathe life into a helplessly lifeless idea, and summon the creative forces necessary to do any more than contemplate how I _might_ do something, rather than _actually_ do it. I stop, push my desire to engage with this idea to the back of my mind, and find something else to do.

This feeling is something I’m intimately familiar with, discovering something so inspiring that I want to drop everything to do it, only to fall into a cycle of procrastination that leads to inevitable disinterest.   

With more muses left behind than exes, I know how to handle our separation gracefully. I forgo dwelling on the creative impotence that ails me, and after giving me and my muse some space to rekindle our relationship, I know when to call it quits. Neither of us is right or wrong; we simply aren’t meant to be. Although, I must admit to the fact that many of these things happen implicitly, placing myself in the position of “ghosting” my muse, who likely deserves more than half-hearted rationalizations about why we’re breaking up.  

This relationship between myself and my muses is a cycle, a feedback loop that has ingrained itself into my psyche to such an extent that noticing its existence is difficult. Doubt overcomes me as I question whether my relationship with my muses has to be this way.     

- What are all of the past muses I’ve let go of?   
- To what extent have I engaged with each of my past muses?   
- At what point in my engagement with these muses has our relationship ended?  
- Are there any of these muses that I still want to engage with?   
- Are any of these muses things that I _actually_ wanted to engage with, or were they simply whims I turned into something larger than what they were ever meant to be?  
- What steps did I take to engage with my muse before eventually separating from it?  
- How do I feel as I think about the muses of my past?   
- Are there commonalities between the muses I’ve either followed-through with or eventually became disinterested in?  

I ask myself questions and dig deeper into the past relationships between myself and my muses. I notice a trend occurring, one that begins shining a light on a likely culprit for my creative misfires over the years, and that culprit is planning.   

Planning, and all manner of actions that arise from it, are a godsend for some, stacking the proverbial cards such that the impossible becomes possible, and facilitating the accomplishment of what one sets out to do. Planning _can_ work. Hell, it works for me all the time with my client projects.  

The incessant activities that comprise “work about work” yields dividends for many, while yielding procrastination, perpetual uncertainty, and a misguided feeling of accomplishment for others. Planning can be a very effective but toxic form of procrastination.

I’ve found myself standing beneath a light shining on my innermost desire or orderliness, guiding my actions towards planning instead of doing. I’ve created no shortage of projects, to-do lists, systems, strategies, plans, timelines, commitments, and goals that are all designed to get me from point A to point B, from idea to creation. Where, then, are my creations?  

Planning is no substitute for doing. To plan is to anticipate, while to do is to create. The former does not preclude the latter, but I'm wary of how I sequence these activities.

My new approach is to create first, plan later. I will plan when systematic approaches towards solving problems or accomplishing tasks make sense, but I will no longer rely on planning to put the wind beneath my creative wings.

Being confronted with one's foibles is difficult but necessary for self-growth. "Don't beat yourself up", I say to myself, feeling a bodily high from the feeling of presence and awareness experienced, well, ideally throughout every day, but if not, resurfaced through periods of self-reflection.     

While many muses lie in my past, buried beneath the remnants of planning, many more lie ahead. Thankfully, I have had no shortage of muses throughout my life. Engaging with programming at an early age is what helped me turn it into a profession. Writing every day gives me the confidence, and hopefully, _some_ technical ability, to pen my thoughts. There will always be something new. The question is, will I engage with it, and if so, how?
