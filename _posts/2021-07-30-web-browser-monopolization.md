I recently stumbled upon an [interesting Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1421078387376918529?s=20) by Jeff Johnson on the state of corporate monopolization of the web, Safari and Chrome, web browser complexity, and fostering competition in the web browser landscape.

I have a different perspective on many points he discussed, although I suggest reading his original thread before continuing.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Safari is buggy&quot; is a valid criticism.<br><br>&quot;Safari is behind Chrome in features&quot; is not a valid criticism.<br><br>Never forget that the browser vendors, including Google and Apple, seized control of the web from the W3C. These few companies have too much power over the web, period.</p>&mdash; Jeff Johnson (@lapcatsoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1421078387376918529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I disagree that browsers having more functionality is problematic. There are implications, but having a full-featured web is democratizing, allowing developers to build websites and applications for devices without worrying about platform-specific constraints.

I don't want to build different applications for different platforms. Building web applications allows me to build once and ship everywhere, so long as the web browsers using them provide a consistent user experience (hence the issue between web developers and Safari).

Ironically, reducing functionality on the web to increase competition might do the opposite of what we would like. In this world, instead of building web applications for Apple devices using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, am I forced to use Apple's programming language and IDE, Swift and Xcode? This doesn't sound appealing to me.

Should the automotive industry have remained stagnant, reducing complexity and functionality for the sake of increased competition? There's a high barrier of entry for automobile manufacturing, but it's not an industry without competition.

What about regulations placed on the automotive industry over the past century that benefit consumers? Regulations increase overhead for manufacturers but improve safety and reliability for consumers. How do you balance that trade-off? 

{% include type/question.html content="How do you balance the trade-off of regulations on companies and industries so that competition and innovation is promoted, not stifled, while respecting the needs of consumers in the industry?<br><br>In this context, how do we incentivize tech companies like Google and Apple to continue investing in web browsers in a way that benefits both the company <em>and</em> the consumer?<br><br>How can the use of the Justice Department's antitrust powers change the dynamic of web browser development?<br><br>What if the paradigm shifts to web browsers being 'sponsored' by corporations?" %}

Regardless of how we get there, I think the incentive structure for corporate involvement in web browser development needs to change. Google and Apple have different incentive structures, which is evident by their choices for Chromium and Safari, respectively. 

We need incentive structures that allow corporations to meet their goals, but not at the expense of the consumer (e.g., privacy, choice of browser) or web developers through unilateral decision-making for the progression of web browsers (we see you, Google).

On the subject of "openness" on the web, just because I cannot reasonably build a web browser that's up-to-date with the W3C standards does not mean that the web is not still "open". It simply means the barrier of entry is so high that I might want to focus my energy elsewhere. 

{% include type/question.html content="What are the principles and features of an 'open' and a 'closed' web?" %}

There are aspects of the web that blur the lines between an open and closed ecosystem. Features for web languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are often implemented, if not outright developed, by corporations, independent of the committees charged with steering their direction. Google is the primary offender for blurring these lines on the web, as they implement platform-specific features and functionality for common web languages, making it difficult for everyone—the W3C, web browser creators, and web developers—to foster an open ecosystem on the web. 

I’m not entirely sure how you solve the problem of Google unilaterally making decisions that impact so much of the web. Some of their feature implementations empower developers. Others are terrible, adding proprietary technology whose goal is to benefit the company, like AMP.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention some impactful web technologies that originated from tech companies. JavaScript was created at Netscape, TypeScript by Microsoft, Go by Google. More time could be afforded to discussing the nuance of these, but that's for another day.

I’m not saying that the web is perfect. There is massive room for improvement for feature parity, security, fostering an open ecosystem, creating incentive structures that benefit corporations and consumers, and more. However, saying 'there's no point in even having "web standards"' is too nihilistic for me. We have to be flexible and learn to grow, adapt and strive for constant improvement. This is as true for the internet as it is for everything else in life. 

Still, I think this is an interesting discussion to have as we fight against corporate monopolization of the internet. There are many problems and many approaches to solving those problems. I'm grateful to folks like Jeff who are opening up this discussion.
