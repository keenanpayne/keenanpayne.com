Boy, do I walk fast. It's as if the only thing that matters is getting from point A to point B. I feel built to move quickly. My long legs give me a stride designed for efficiency. Efficiency to... _walk_.  

I'm not aware of my stride most of the time. No, I'm just doing my thing without a care in the world. It's usually on lackadaisical walkabouts where I find myself questioning the speed at which I propel myself through the world. I slow down; I feel weird.  

**Why do I walk so fast?**  

Moving slowly is nice. I enjoy the stroll, and I notice my body loosen up. Now I'm going with the flow.  

I embrace my saunter, and in doing so, I notice the gait of others. Observing my fast-moving compatriots, I feel outpaced.  

**Am I getting left behind?**  

I become distracted—lost in thought or looking at my phone—and once again, I'm moving full-speed ahead. It must be a pattern.  

Resettled in my stride, I begin contemplating my subconscious rush. Time doesn't permit a full divulgence of exactly where and how this manifests, but needless to say, it's a frequent occurrence.  

**Why am I rushing?**  

An acute awareness of my mortality likely plays a role in my subconscious desire to move quickly. I have so many things I want to accomplish and experience in my life. Thinking about it, I suppose these are my most significant sources of anxiety.  

But I cannot dodge mortality, so when it's all said and done, there will always be the possibility of _more_. Perhaps my focus can shift from what I'm doing to how I'm doing it. I want to enjoy the journey.  

**Aha!**  

If there is a figurative scoreboard for my life, I'm in charge of it. Why stress out by rushing, only to miss the joy and serenity of my journey?  

Whether a stroll through my neighborhood or my next big project, sustained momentum will get me to where I want to be.
