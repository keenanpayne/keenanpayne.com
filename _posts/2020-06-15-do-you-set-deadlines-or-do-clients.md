When you take your car to a mechanic for repairs, you wouldn't tell the mechanic when the repairs will be completed. Instead, you tell the mechanic what's wrong and the mechanic estimates the amount of time it will take to finish the cars ahead of yours, as well as your car. Using this information, the mechanic can provide an estimate as to when the work on your car will be completed. This makes the work of a mechanic largely proactive. 

Contrast this with the work of a firefighter. When the services of a firefighter are required, the firefighter doesn't think about what work they need to do before fighting a fire. No, their work is fighting the fire, so when they are alerted of a fire, they must respond as quickly as possible. This makes the work of a firefighter largely reactive.

Let's use these examples to create a frame-of-reference for how we think about project deadlines. 

As a freelancer, effectively setting deadlines is essential to managing my stress levels and happiness with my work. I have worked on projects with deadlines that have required 70-hour workweeks which caused me to feel stress, tension, and anxiety. Conversely, I have worked on projects with deadlines that required 25-hour workweeks which have given me relaxation, freedom, and happiness.

The latter is how I prefer to work, so I strive to set deadlines that allow me that freedom. However, learning how to set and communicate deadlines is something that has taken me a long time to learn. I hope that by sharing my experience, you will be able to avoid the pitfalls that I've fallen into throughout my career, and you can begin managing the deadlines for your work in a way that manifests relaxation, happiness, and freedom.

**Are you currently setting timelines like a mechanic or a firefighter?**

## Who sets the deadline?
How you set a deadline for a project is going to be largely context-dependent. One client might require that you work with a deadline that they have set for a project, while another client will require you to estimate and set the deadline for a project. 

Neither option is "right", and both can be appropriate depending on the circumstances. Let's discuss the differences surrounding the circumstances of the client or the contractor setting project deadlines so that we can understand when each is appropriate. 

### When clients set deadlines
If you need to get your hair cut today for an event tomorrow, then you will visit barbershops until you find one that can cut your hair today. The event tomorrow is a deadline for when you must have your hair cut, so you don't have the liberty to schedule in advance.

Similar circumstances can apply for a client looking to hire a contractor for a project. If the client has a deadline for the completion of a project, they will reach out to as many contractors as necessary until they find somebody who can complete the work by the specified time.

The rule-of-thumb for allowing a client to set a project deadline is if they have a **hard deadline** that the work must be completed by. A hard deadline is a fixed date that is outside of the control of the client. Examples of hard deadlines include: 
- Financial deadlines (e.g., fiscal year, taxes)
- Deadlines set by another company or entity that is working with the client
- Disaster occurs requiring immediate attention

You *might* let a client set a project deadline if they have a **soft deadline** that the work must be completed by. A soft deadline is a flexible date that is *not* outside of the control of the client, but might be difficult to move. Examples of soft deadlines include: 
- Scheduled events (e.g., press conferences, board meeting, investor presentation)
- Product launches
- Seasonality (e.g., holidays)

There are times when the client needs to set a deadline, and you will need to meet that deadline if you accept the project. However, in my experience, the deadlines that a client has rarely fall under the category of "hard deadline" or "soft deadline", but instead, usually typically fall under the category of "artificial deadline".

    TODO: Quick one sentence describing what an artificial deadline is

I like to think of working with client deadlines as similar to the mindset of a firefighter because I am being reactive in responding to what the client needs. 

### Setting deadlines yourself
If you purchase new furniture for your office, you get to determine when you want to assemble the furniture. You estimate that you can finish in 5 hours next weekend. No one told you when to do this, you decided that by estimating how much time the assembly would take. 

Similar circumstances can apply for clients looking to hire a contractor for a project. The client might not have a specific deadline in mind for a project and instead, relies on the expertise of the contractor to determine how long a project will take to complete. 

There will be many times when you will be tasked with setting the deadline for a project. Some examples include: 
- The client lacks any hard or soft deadlines for their project
- The client lacks context surrounding how long the work for their project might take (i.e., the client has never worked with a web developer before)
- The client lacks the confidence to dictate a deadline to a contractor
- The client is more interested in completing the work well, not quickly

I like to think of myself setting project deadlines as similar to the mindset of a mechanic because I am being proactive in determining how long something will take to complete. 

## Differences to consider
Having a deadline set by a client and setting a deadline yourself are not only different in their outcomes, which is the date by which the work needs to be completed, but also in the process by which you that outcome is realized.

### Working backwards or working forwards
Working backwards during a project means that the deadline informs how the work will be completed. In this instance, deadlines are set by the client which requires the contractor to work backwards to meet the deadline. 

An example of working backwards is filing your taxes in the United States. There is a deadline set by the IRS for filing taxes, which means that you need to work backwards when planning your taxes so that you can meet the deadline (or, just file tax extensions every year like me üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

Working forwards means that the scope of work informs the deadline. In this instance, you are setting the deadline for a project, so you need to determine how long a project will take so that you can set a deadline. 

An example of working forwards is remodeling your home. If you are remodeling your kitchen, maybe that work takes 2 months. If you are remodeling your entire house, maybe that work takes 2 years. Your deadline for accomplishing the work depends on the scope of the work, and it is up to you to take into account how the scope of work will inform when you can expect the work to be done.

## Conclusion
Mechanics and firefighters handle their work under different sets of circumstances, thereby requiring different responses. The mechanic proactively sets deadlines by estimating how long their work will take to complete, while the firefighter works reactively by fighting fires as they occur, and doing their job as quickly as possible. Neither mode of operation is correct, each are context-dependent. 

This same principle applies to how we think about setting deadlines for a project. There will be times when the circumstances require a client to set a deadline for a project to be completed, and you must work backwards to meet this deadline. Other times the client will defer to your experience and expertise as a contractor to set a deadline, and you must estimate how long the project will take complete in order to provide a deadline.
