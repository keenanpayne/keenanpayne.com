[Make Art Not Content](https://open.spotify.com/show/2RYqdOdca8BinN0Jc9Zind) is an excellent podcast from [Father Bronques](https://www.instagram.com/bronques/?hl=en) that I just started listening to. It's concise, but impactful. Bronques addresses the hurdles that many creative people encounter heads-on and in doing so, he provides some great advice on how to frame your mindset towards creative endeavors.

## Notes

A sign of successful people isn’t whether or not they fail — everyone fails at some point — it’s how frequently they fail compared with how frequently they succeed.

Move away from the day-to-day successes and focus on accomplishing things over a longer period of time. You’re only amazing after you do something amazing repeatedly for many years.

  - Making it one week into doing something that your want to accomplish is great, but can you make it to day 50, day 100, or day 365?
  - Think in terms of “21 days” — what can you accomplish over the course of three weeks?
  - Setting daily goals is what helps you succeed in the long term, but associating your success with what you do in a single day is too small and insignificant.

**Highlight:** Failure is what happens when you start something new.

**Highlight:** Discipline is a word people use when they’re still leaving the possibility open to not achieving the goal. People who have made up their minds to change don’t need discipline, they just do what needs to be done.

**Highlight:** Imagine your success as inevitable.

If you are truly driven to do what it is you say you want to do, then taking the steps to do it won’t be difficult because there are few things you would rather do than making progress towards your goals.
