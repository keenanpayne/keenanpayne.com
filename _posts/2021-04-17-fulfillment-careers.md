  <p>Hey Keenan! It's Brad, from Default Prime. Long time no see!</p>

  <p>You willing to chat with me about software/web development? I might pivot careers because I have felt stagnant in my current field (copywriting) for a while. I'm less concerned with how to learn the ropes (spent a few months self-teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics) and more curious, before I invest more time learning, about your feelings of fulfillment.</p>

  <p>As a copywriter, at the end of the day, I feel like a salesman that uses words. Without writing a novel, I'd like to do something that lets me be more creative and helpful, and work in service of something more than shareholder profit. Wishful thinking — I know!</p>

  <p>I'm sure you've pondered this at Asana and as a freelancer. Before I invest more time in learning development, I would value your perspective if you have the time for an email or two. If not, don't sweat it. Lemme know and I can reach out another time.</p>

  <p>All the best,<br>
  Brad</p>

Hey Brad! Wow, long time no see indeed. I'm so happy to hear from you. It's been forever.

I'm willing to talk with most anyone about anything, so you're in good hands insofar as anything I'm saying is of interest to you. I'll warn you, though, I'm a verbose writer and your email has inspired me, so I went all-in on sharing my thoughts with you. 

_You'll want to read this when you have a few minutes. Grab a nice drink._

## Searching for fulfillment at Asana

I'm happy you chose to email me about fulfillment. This is a subject that's been on my mind a lot for the past five or six years. Perhaps it's less surprising since I believe you and I are roughly the same age  — I'm 27 currently — and we're both creative individuals.

While I was at Asana, I frequently contemplated what I was doing, who I was doing things for, who I was, and what I was putting into the world. This coincided with, and perhaps informed, a great deal of existential dread. These feelings first arose because of the boredom I experienced while working. By the time I had gotten my job at Asana, I had already been building websites professionally for over five years, so I had a pretty short period of time to enjoy the "newness" of what I was doing (this relates to a concept called the "[hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)"). 

I eventually became a person that did a particular type of web development at the company and was essentially "typecast" in my role. I'll admit that I could have done more to alleviate this point of frustration, but that only came through self-reflection after leaving the company. I had little help expediting that learning for me.

In this complacency, I felt unfulfilled in my work and jaded towards my professional circumstances. I saw myself as a cog in a machine and I was dissatisfied with what I was spending my time doing. These feelings coincided with the first time that I reflected on capitalism. I began seeing my work as merely a means to an end for corporations to generate a profit. 

{% include type/p-large.html content="I got depressed, smoked a lot of weed, and saw something I used to love doing — web development — as a burden rather than an opportunity or passion." %}

**These are also all signs of burnout.**

I was also discontent with the control I had over my career. Asana offered a lot of flexibility working as well as wonderful perks. Still, not having control over what projects I was working on and the circumstances surrounding those projects made me decide to leave and become a freelancer. 

My hypothesis was that having the freedom to choose my projects and exerting greater control over the circumstances of my career would make my work more fulfilling. 

It did, and it didn't.

## Freelancing is more fulfilling, to an extent

Freelancing alleviated many pains that I was experiencing while working at Asana.

- I can take off work whenever I want, so long as there aren't projects I'm committed to working on. 
- I get to choose whatever projects I get to work on, which has granted me the opportunity to learn many new things. 
- I  have greater control over deadlines _to an extent_, though some clients are still obstinate when it comes to having flexible project timelines.   
  - Still, I get to decline projects with terrible timelines, which I couldn't do at Asana, so there's some improvement. 
- I even make more money now than I did at Asana. 

**If you had told me  five years ago that I could be self-employed under all of these circumstances, I wouldn't have believed it.**

Even with all of this, I'm still unfulfilled. What I'm doing, who I'm doing things for, who I am, and what I'm putting into the world are all questions that I contemplate regularly and I've yet to answer satisfactorily. 

I'm still a cog in a machine, but I'm a cog that has slightly more freedom — both in terms of how I get to organize my work and financially — than other cogs.

## Searching for fulfillment

Of course, like any good scientist, I have new hypotheses as I search for answers to these questions. My latest iteration on an "answer" to this question is that it's not what I do, but who I serve. I want to serve people, not corporations. I want to act out of desire, not an obligation. I want to utilize my creativity as I experience it, not relegate it to my "free time".

I'm passionate about writing, reading, learning, coding, teaching, among many other things. I want to indulge these passions when I'm feeling inspired to indulge them.

> Queue eye-rolls to the person with all of the privilege and opportunity in the world say that nothing is ever enough and that he'll be happy "once he can do things on his terms".

**I mean, that is what I'm saying; I can survive a few eye-rolls.**

I've thought about switching careers wholesale in the past, and I think it would provide some relief, but only for a certain period (back on the treadmill). I believe fulfillment comes from something deeper — aligning what I'm doing day-to-day with your values. 

{% include type/p-large.html content="I've experienced the most fulfillment when I'm doing things that are a genuine expression of who I am, not something I do because our economy is set up so that I must work to pay my bills." %}

I ask myself a lot of questions as a form of self-reflection. It helps me capture my thoughts and elaborate on them over time. Here are some questions I've asked myself related to this:

- What do I value?
- Who do I want to serve in the world and why?
- What do I currently do that is fulfilling (/exciting /interesting, etc.)?
- What do I currently do that is unfulfilling (/unexciting /uninteresting, etc.)?
- What impact do I want to have on the world?
- If I could drop everything and do one thing right now, what would it be?
- How might I change my current circumstances to make what I do more fulfilling in the short term?

Will switching careers to web development be more fulfilling to you? Probably not if you want to do something other than work in the service of shareholder profit. Perhaps it will if you'll express yourself and your creativity in a way that aligns with your values, who you want to serve, and the impact you want to have on the world.

Everything I've written is a _very_ long-winded way of saying, "I don't know, man". The topic of fulfillment will always prompt engagement from my brain, so consider this a brain dump.

Again, thanks for reaching out. I really appreciate it. The lack of fulfillment you're experiencing at your job aside, I hope you're doing well and staying safe.
