Unprompted, I receive a message from George Hoqqanen, a friend and mentor of mine, with a simple question: "what are you confused about?" 

Huh, that's broad. So broad that I've procrastinated responding to this message for a week, and aside from some internal mental digressions, I haven't given the question much thought. Every time I ask myself this question, I find myself at the tail-end of a mental avalanche, buried beneath a pile of unknowing. And who's to blame me when confronted with a question whose answers reveal more obscurity than clarity?   

I'm going to work my way down this mountain by asking one question at a time. 

**What am I confused about? Many things.**

Why did I procrastinate indulging this writing prompt? Why didn't I begin jotting down my thoughts sooner? I suppose that the time commitment required to answer this question played a role in my procrastination. Not that I knew what the time commitment for answering this question would be. Still, I had a sense that this would be a multi-hour endeavor. As such creative endeavors go, I'll experience no shortage of self-doubt, overthinking, and a crippling obsession with the "perfection" of everything I do.  

Why does intensive writing need to be such an arduous endeavor? I mean, the act of writing what I'm thinking about isn't tremendously difficult. In fact, this type of writing can be effortless without focusing on editing, self-censorship, the reader, and goals for the finished product. I know this, yet I allow these inconveniences to lurk behind the corners of my mind. Accomplishments, if they happen at all, happen in _spite_ of my hang-ups, rather than _because_ of them. Oof.   

Why not make my writing effortless? Need I stack the cards so that I'm always looking uphill? Probably not. I edit while I write a lot. Every turn of phrase, sentence, and word is calculated so I can articulate each thought to the best of my abilities. I wouldn't want you to think that I'm unintelligent, would I? Why do I care what you think about my intelligence? Even if I could know how you perceive my intelligence, why would that even matter? Would my actions reflect how I want to be perceived rather than an authentic representation of who I am? Am I sure that my actions right now are an authentic representation of who I am? Whew.   

If I'm writing to an audience of people at this moment, I couldn't tell you who this audience might be, save for the few friends, family members, and acquaintances that care about me enough personally to read what I write from time to time. I hope they don't think I'm going crazy.

But what of goals? What's a life with no goals? I plan to retire at the age of 55 by having millions of dollars accumulated across a series of investments that we — myself and my financial advisor — hope to have a predictable long-term return. I want to secure for myself a career as a sought-after web developer, so I can continue to earn income by applying the knowledge I have so that others can meet _their_ goals. I apply my knowledge of web development in this way because people pay me a lot of money to do it. I need money to pay the bills and meet my long-term financial planning and retirement goals. I dislike making and thinking about financial goals.  

Goals come in all shapes and sizes. I have a goal every morning to make a delicious cup of pour-over coffee for myself. On many days I achieve this goal. At the present moment, my goal is to answer this question from George so he can read my writing and have his perception of me shaped by it. Is every action in service of a goal?   

---  

But how do I determine the actions I take? Actions are an atomic unit of being. It's through action that life is made possible; it's the reason I'm writing these very words. But how do we determine what action to take? If experience is predicated on constantly answering that question, I'd think I would be better at answering it after living twenty-seven years. I haven't, and I haven't.   

[//]: # (TODO: "Actions are an atomic unit of being. It's through action that life is made possible; it's the reason I'm writing these very words." can be a `p-large` callout)

I take many actions just to stay alive. Other actions allow me to stay afloat in a late-stage capitalistic country, while others allow me to engage in meaningful things.

---  

What's meaningful to me? My relationships with people I love and care about, the wellbeing of myself and those I care about, learning and growing, and spending time helping and empowering others. Aligning my actions in service of these — which are effectively my foundational values — usually makes time spent feel worthwhile. From these, I obtain life force, and with that, I try to return the favor. This is a significant positive feedback loop in my life.  

Did you notice the absence of worrying about money in my list of values? Yet, I still spend much time striving for my financial goals through the actions I take. Are my actions and my values out of lockstep? Of course, I'm feeding the capitalistic machine and striving for the "American dream."  

To what extent can my actions and my values stay out of alignment? Aren't my actions indirectly in service of my values if what I'm doing is facilitated through their completion? Let's not forget that proper retirement planning begets an indeterminate future where our freedom has been _earned_ by working most of our lives for it.  

Through our actions, we've _earned_ it.

Oh, capitalism, you sly little devil. It took a while before I began to understand the economic and political systems that provided me with a middle-class upbringing that ensured food was on the table and Christmas presents were under a Christmas tree. I lacked the imagination to wonder whether children might live under entirely different circumstances. In fact, I didn't even make any assumptions as to how anyone else was growing up because, as far as I could see, everyone's lives seemed stable. I thought we were all having a grand time.   

The older I've gotten, the more I benefit from these same systems that spoiled me as a child, and with greater clarity, I see how others get fucked. I was born into a race starting further ahead than others.

We've achieved so much as a species, yet we've relegated ourselves to running on a hamster wheel of our own design. Why do we run? Why a hamster wheel? Haven't we done enough? Is there not room to harness our industriousness with love and passion rather than our survivalist tendencies? There are so many ways to organize societies, economies, and politics. Are we confident that what we have designed is truly the magnum opus?  

And to what end do we toil? Ask your manager; they have the mission statement memorized by now. They're bought in; everyone's bought in — we're making the world a better place. For whom does this world improve? Shareholders in the business, primarily, although the tertiary impact can certainly be far-reaching. I'm not saying that sowing the seeds of others is meaningless, but is it meaningful to me?  

I want to engage in a broader discussion on how we can all live meaningful lives, reaping the rewards of seeds sown by our ancestors. I'm not saying we don't need to continue paying it forward — we do — but let's stop paying it upward, rewarding the few at the expense of the many, and determine how we can all live dignified, equitable lives. It seems obvious.

How do I feel about what I've just written? Does what I've captured convey what I want it to convey? Is my writing anything more than an anxiety-ridden screed? I don't know, and I also don't care.
