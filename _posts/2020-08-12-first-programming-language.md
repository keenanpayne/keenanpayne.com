Folks who want to learn how to code but don't know where to start commonly ask: *"which programming language should I learn?"* This is an apt question, considering the number of programming languages that exist. It might truly seem possible that there is one "right" language to learn when presented with so many options. Plus, who wants to spend time learning the "wrong" option?

This is a legitimate concern and one I might have myself if I were learning how to code today. However, I'm here to tell you that if you are just beginning your coding journey, there is no universal right or wrong language to learn. 

As someone who has taught himself how to code and has mentored others on their journeys, I want to share my approach towards picking a first programming language to learn. My goal is for you to spend less time deliberating and more time learning and creating.

## My background learning how to code

I could not have predicted the languages that I would learn throughout my career. In my 10+ years as a programmer, I've worked with:

<ul class="-three-columns">
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>ColdFusion</li>
  <li>Visual Basic</li>
  <li>Basic</li>
  <li>ActionScript</li>
</ul>

**How could I have chosen the "right" option from that list?**

The truth is, I just started coding (in my case, with HTML and CSS), and I learned new programming languages as my desire to solve new problems evolved. When I wanted to build a WordPress theme from scratch, I learned PHP. [^1] When I wanted to make my static website more interactive, I learned JavaScript. The impetus for my learning is typically finding solutions to problems that I encounter. 

What if you don't have any problems to solve because you just started learning? Let's go over some strategies you can use to find a programming language to learn.

[^1]: I even wrote a tutorial about it back in 2011 for [Onextrapixel](https://onextrapixel.com/how-to-code-a-wordpress-3-0-theme-from-scratch/), which garnered thousands of shares online. That was pretty exhilarating for 17-year old me ðŸ˜…

## Choosing the "right" language

Do you have an idea of the dream job you want to land with your future coding skills? Great, learn the programming languages that are required to get that job.

If you don't have an idea of your dream job, fear not. The more you learn, the more you will understand what types of jobs are available to you. You can still using [job listings](#look-at-job-listings) to discover programming languages that are used for different roles, or you can [make an educated guess](#make-an-educated-guess) to choose a language to learn.

Not sure how to discover which programming languages are used for a particular job? I've outlined a few strategies you can use to find out.

### Look at job listings

Pretend like you're hunting for a job. Where would you start? You would likely search for job listings. You can find job listings on company websites and on job boards, both of which you can find with a [quick search](https://www.google.com/search?q=programming%20job%20board). Look through job listings and see what the requirements are for languages to know.

It's worth noting that you will see *many* languages in job listings. How many you encounter will vary depending on the specificity of your search. Knowing what specific job title you would like, such as "web developer" or "backend developer," can help narrow down your options. 

{% include type/note.html content="If you have no idea what to search, I recommend taking a look at job listings and reading what each role entails. Once you find a role that sounds interesting, use that job title as you continue searching listings." %}

Regardless of how specific you are in your search, you will still see more languages than you can learn at once. How do you choose between them? I would keep a tally for each language that you encounter, and after completing your search, learn the language that occurred most frequently. 

### Ask a professional

Do you know somebody who is a programmer? If so, reach out and learn about what they do on a daily basis and what sort of projects they work on. Does their work sound interesting to you? If so, ask them what they would recommend learning and how they would start.

If you lack a friendly neighborhood programmer, search some out on LinkedIn or Twitter. Search for job titles in people's bios and see if you can reach out. Send a message explaining that you are interested in learning how to code and that you would love to ask a few questions if they have the interest or time.

Some folks might allow you to ask questions online, some might be open to a call or video chat, and others might not respond. Be respectful of their preference, and be grateful for anyone willing to share their time with you. 

Once you get in touch with someone willing to talk, be prepared. Do your homework ask specific questions such as: 
- *"What does your day-to-day at X job look like?"*
- *"What are the types of problems that you solve at X job?"*
- *"What are the languages/tools that you use for your job?"*
- *"What skills would you expect a candidate to know if you were going to hire them?"*

Avoid asking questions like:
- *"How do I get started programming?"*

A question like that is too broad and is better suited towards a [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20do%20I%20get%20started%20programming).

### Making an educated guess

If you want to forego all the overhead of looking at job listings or reaching out to other programmers, you can simply make an educated guess to start learning a programming language. 

You can use this great article from Raygun titled: [Top 43 Programming Languages: When and How to Use Them
](https://raygun.com/blog/programming-languages/). This article will give you a high-level overview of what the most popular programming languages are, how they are used, and what the job market for the language looks like.

{% include type/tip.html content="There's nothing wrong with guessing. The best part is, you can learn <em>any</em> programming language and apply the principles that you learned to any other programming language." %}


## Identifying the "wrong" language

The only wrong language to learn is any language that you don't enjoy learning. If you've decided to learn something and you're not enjoying it, it's time to change. 

It might be the content you're using that needs to change or the content's format. For example, if you're learning how to write JavaScript from a book and aren't enjoying it, try learning JavaScript from a video course instead. Change the content and format then give it another go. Still not enjoying what you're learning? It's time to start learning something different.

There are too many options available for you to spend time learning something that you don't enjoy. Whether it's the language or the resource, change things up as needed until you find the combination that works.

{% include type/p-large.html content="Use what you now know about how you prefer to learn and what you prefer to learn to guide you in the future." %}

## When something clicks, stick with it
Once you find a programming language that you enjoy learning, stick with it. I like to call the first phase of learning the *"incubation phase"* because of the need to foster whatever you're learning so that you can continue to be motivated to grow.

**It's critically important to continue learning and fueling your desire to learn.**

Now isn't the time to overthink what you're learning. Avoid asking yourself questions like: 
- *"Will this get me a job in the future?"*
- *"Is what I'm learning going to be relevant in X years?"*
- *"Is X thing popular right now?"*
- *"Are other people also learning X?"*
- *"What are other people's opinions of X?"*

Instead, ask yourself questions like: 
- *"Am I enjoying what I'm learning?"*
- *"Do I want to continue learning X thing?"*

**Don't question something that you enjoy learning, just continue learning.**

You can worry about finding a job later. If you're just getting started as a programmer, chances are you don't have the skills to get a job anyways, so there's no point worrying about it. Cross that bridge when you get there. 

I also encourage you not to worry about the relevance or popularity of *any* programming language that you enjoy learning. Just because a language isn't relevant right now doesn't mean it won't be relevant in the future. It also doesn't mean there aren't folks just like you who are interested in learning about it. 

Just think, you could play a pivotal role in reviving a long-forgotten language (or creating a language yourself ðŸ˜‰). You wouldn't have the opportunity to do that if you were learning an already popular language.

## Go learn a programming language

There has never been a better time than now to become a programmer. There are countless languages to learn, and numerous resources you can use to learn. If programming is something that you want to do, there's no excuse for you not to do it. You just have to get started.

Are you a programmer? If so, what was the first language that you learned, and are you still using it? 

Are you just getting started programming? If so, what was the last thing that you built with your newly-acquired skills? It doesn't matter how small it was. I genuinely want to know!

As always, I always enjoy learning from other's experiences in the comments below, or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KeenanPayne_).
