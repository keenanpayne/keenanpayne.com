  overview:
    "I helped the GetWhys founders launch their initial website in Q3, 2024 as they solidified their product offerings and signed their first customers before endeavoring to secure seed funding. <br /><br />Six months later, I helped the small but mighty GetWhys team redesign and rebuild their marketing website after <strong>securing $2.75m in seed funding</strong>. <br /><br />The GetWhys team has been delighted by how well <strong>their new website converts</strong>, and how it portrays their growing brand.
